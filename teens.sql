So the obvious question is: How do we, living in the new morality, express the teachings of Scripture and a God-honoring lifestyle rooted in a biblical morality?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In this brief article, I will suggest six ideas.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>1. Our Identity Is Rooted in Christ&nbsp;</p><p>Children and teens who see their Christian identity as a list of rules and regulations that they need to follow, in order to keep God or their parents happy, will ultimately rebel against those rules, or will take pride in those rules and become haughty and judgmental of others. Instead, if their identity is rooted in who Jesus is and who they are in Christ, they can both value the teachings of Scripture, but also love others who may have different views in the midst of cultural changes around us.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2. Live Unashamed and Unembarrassed&nbsp;</p><p>We need to be unashamed and unembarrassed to teach what the Scriptures teach, but to do so in a way that acknowledges that this is different from what the world teaches.&nbsp;</p><p>I think weâ€™re in a key moment in our culture where appealing to commonly held values to help our children to make better decisions makes less sense today than perhaps ever before. Iâ€™m not saying that things have always been right or correct, and I donâ€™t think there was ever a perfect era in the past, but when it comes to issues of morality in our culture, particularly around sexual values, there have been certain standards influenced by our Judeo-Christian worldview that have been perceived as the right thing to do and that good people would do. That consensus no longer exists.&nbsp;</p><p>And if that consensus no longer exists, we can no longer appeal to â€œthis is the right thing to do, as everyone knowsâ€ and â€œthis is what good kids doâ€ because good kids in our cultureâ€™s worldview are now increasingly doing things that Christians donâ€™t believe and increasingly valuing things that Christians donâ€™t value.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, in this new reality, we need a few key things, such as:&nbsp;</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>Greater grounding in the worldview of what Christians believe and why.</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>An understanding of the Scriptures and what the Scriptures teach and why.</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>A worldview that says to children and teens, â€œYou do these things not because theyâ€™re the things that the â€˜goodâ€™ kids do but because weâ€™re followers of Jesus and we live differently from the world in some ways.â€</p><p><br></p><p>3. Be Unapologetic</p><p>We all need to be unapologetic about speaking about the brokenness of the world, our culture and ourselves. The reality is, if we hold up a standard of moral superiority, weâ€™ll either drive our kids to despair or to prideâ€”despair in that they canâ€™t live up to it, or pride in that they have. Both are sins, though different expressions of sin.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, a better approach is to help our children to realize that weâ€™re all sinners and that we all struggle with sin; that brokenness impacts who we are and that it impacts our morality. But perhaps, and maybe even most importantly even for this moment, it impacts them, and because it impacts them, a humble approach recognizing the brokenness of the world and individuals will cause us to rely, by grace, on the work of Christ in the midst of this broken world.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Break the Tyranny of Conformity</p><p>We need to break the tyranny of conformity thatâ€™s so prevalent in the lives of our children. When I was young, the most terrifying thing was to be different from everyone else. Of course, as you age, the reality of this shifts and youâ€™re much more open to being different.</p><p>But too many children and teens often function like the well-known Japanese proverb, â€œA nail that stands out gets hammered down.â€ Therefore, they work exceedingly hard to fit in. However, that doesnâ€™t work for the Christian. Thus, letâ€™s look to scriptural teachings that speak about how we shine like lights in the darkened world and how we stand out in the midst of a darkened culture by reflecting the light of Christ (see Philippians 2:16). Embrace early, and embrace often, the idea that conformity isnâ€™t a value, but instead, that we might be conformed to the image of Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>5. Share Your Own Imperfections&nbsp;</p><p>We have to share with our children our own struggles, brokenness, and failures so that they might see that weâ€™re imperfect creatures seeking to follow a perfect God and His standards.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is, you and I have done things or made mistakes that maybe our children donâ€™t knowâ€”that weâ€™ve been tempted or that weâ€™ve even succumbed to that temptation. So when appropriate, we want to share. When the opportunity arises, we want to be fellow strugglers, yes struggling at different times and in different ways, but fellow strugglers in the midst of the worldâ€™s brokenness.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>6. Press On&nbsp;</p><p>So in conclusion, the advice of this article can be summed up in one thingâ€”teach your children to embrace that weâ€™re a peculiar people â€œset forth that you may proclaim the praises of the One who called you out of darkness into His marvelous lightâ€ (1 Peter 2:9). As a peculiar people, we have to embrace the difference to find a better wayâ€”a way that is rooted in the identity of who we are in Christâ€”thatâ€™s made secure in who God is as our Creator, to shape us for a better way.&nbsp;</p><p>He has created us, therefore He knows us, and because He knows us, He gives us guidelines and directions to guide us. Those guidelines and directions are worthy of living a life different from the world.&nbsp;</p><p>In the midst of this new morality we go back to the morality thatâ€™s rooted, not even in history, but ultimately in the nature of God Himself. Who we are in Christ shapes how we live, and how we live is different from the world around us.&nbsp;</p><p>Thatâ€™s raising kids in a confused culture.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Ed Stetzer&nbsp;</p><p>Author and speaker</p>', '14.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 08:49:55', 'Jun 30, 2021', '6-Biblical-Messages-that-Will-Make-You-a-Better-Parent', '', '2.jpg'),
(60, '1', '6 Ways To Get a Grip on Time Management with Your Teen', '<p>It was a spectacle, getting to school in the morning. My mom was a teacher at my high school, and most days we drove together. I regularly underestimated how long my morning routine would take, hurling myself into the passenger seat at the last minute, makeup and books flying. There were real, and sometimes embarrassing, consequences to this ... such as the morning I arrived at school without my shoes!</p><p>&nbsp;Teenagers know they are supposed to manage their time. But they either don\'t know how, or simply choose not to. Rather than dictating to your teen how he should be using his time, teach him the skills to make those decisions for himself.</p><p>Jesus instructs us to be realistic about our plans: \"For which of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn\'t first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?\" (Luke 14:28). When your teen learns to allocate his time appropriately to the things that matter, he is learning not just time management, but time stewardship. The following two questions may be a helpful starting point in teaching your teen to honor God with the moments he has been given.</p><p><br></p><p>What\'s Getting in the Way?</p><p>Teens have their own unique obstacles that prevent them from using their time wisely. However, here are a few they might talk about.</p><p><br></p><p>Busyness (too much or not enough).&nbsp;</p><p>Being busy is usually a good thing for teens. But too many commitments can lead to stress and exhaustion, and too few can lead to isolation and depression. Ask your teen to list all of her commitments and evaluate each one. Does the commitment bring life? Does it ignite passion and interest? Does it connect her to others or help her develop a God-given gift? Help her remember that there is a season for everything, and sometimes you just can\'t do it all.</p><p><br></p><p>Lack of organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Disorganization can double the time it takes to accomplish a task. Don\'t impose your own system on your teen, but help him think of tools he can use, such as a daily planner, colored folders, or a schedule for cleaning his backpack.</p><p><br></p><p>Perfectionism.&nbsp;</p><p>Some teens would rather do nothing at all than do something halfway, so they procrastinate or spend too much time on something so they can do it perfectly. If your teen struggles with this, see if you can get her to open up about her fear of failure. Remind her that mistakes are learning experiences, and help her set realistic goals for herself.</p><p><br></p><p>Being overwhelmed by large tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>When work piles up, paralysis can set in. If your teen falls behind, sit down together with a calendar and make a plan. Talk to the school counselor or teachers so that a realistic deadline for makeup work can be established. And if it\'s an issue of procrastinating on an unwelcome task at home, suggest setting the goal of spending 10 minutes on the task and stopping. Usually starting is the hardest part, and then motivation builds.</p><p><br></p><p>Lack of time or place for efficient studying.&nbsp;</p><p>I once worked with a student who would study in her bathtub because that was the only place that was quiet! Thirty minutes of focused effort is more effective than two hours of distracted effort. The kitchen table works for some, the bedroom desk for others, and the coffee shop with headphones still for others. Let your teen tell you what works best, but discourage studying in bed, as it can affect the quality of sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Digital distractions.&nbsp;</p><p>It\'s no question that our electronic devices distract us, not just from being productive but from being in the moment. They pull our attention constantly from important relationships and commitments. Set some house rules that everyone follows, such as being tech-free after 9 p.m. or no devices at the dinner table.</p><p><br></p><p>What\'s in it for You?</p><p>Sometimes we focus so much on telling teens how they\'re managing their time ineffectively that we forget to describe the benefits of using time well. Here are a few benefits that occur with good time stewardship:</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>Growing closer to God</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>Having enough free time for spontaneity</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>Better physical and emotional health</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>Getting enough sleep</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>Having time for friends</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>Keeping stress at a manageable level</p><p>â€¢<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span>Accomplishing important personal goals</p><p>God wants us to experience the goodness of time well spent. In fact, this is why He commands us to observe the Sabbath (Ex. 20:8). We should set aside time in our week for rest, fun, feasting, and worship. When we do, we can approach work or school with energy and focus. Teach your teenager to prioritize her values, and then plan her life accordingly. As she learns to be a godly steward of her time, she will find that her days are less stressful and more enjoyable. She will have a better relationship with God and with others around her. And she just might get to school with her shoes on.</p><p>Gretchen Williams Raley</p>', '7.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 08:50:50', 'Jun 30, 2021', '6-Ways-To-Get-a-Grip-on-Time-Management-with-Your-Teen', '', '2.jpg'),
(61, '1', '5 Ways to Open Lines of Communication with Your Teen', '<p>One of the biggest complaints from parents and teenagers alike is that there is often little or no communication between the two groups. Perhaps youâ€™re like one discouraged mom who said to me, â€œIâ€™ve tried to talk with my daughter but she just shuts me down. Iâ€™ve tried everything to let her know I care but she just wonâ€™t let me in any more.â€ Or maybe youâ€™re like the frustrated dad who told me the only thing his son would ever say to him was â€œyou just donâ€™t understand.â€&nbsp;</p><p>In such cases teens and parents alike are hurting. Parents would love to know how to talk to their kids and most teens would love for that to happen; they simply think their parents are out of touch. The good news is there is something that can be done to keep the lines of communication open between you and your teenager.</p><p><br></p><p>First, show genuine interest in your teenâ€™s life.&nbsp;</p><p>Often a teenager will perceive his parent to be too busy to really talk. The times that conversations do occur, your son or daughter might think youâ€™re preoccupied even though you think youâ€™re talking. Your one word responses or grunts say to your teen that you do indeed have other things on your mind. Make sure youâ€™re actually listening and engaging. Speak with understanding. Ask questions. Be interested in what your daughter is even if you have no interest in it at all. Make every effort to ask heart-felt questions and get wrapped-up in what your child is wrapped-up in at a given moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, be truly empathetic with your teen.&nbsp;</p><p>Your daughter may be trying to open up or tell you something really important in her life. If you respond with opinions that donâ€™t seem connected to her world, if you spit out platitudes or orders without seeming to empathize, if you donâ€™t seem to take into account every factor weighing on your childâ€™s heart, or if you tend to give advice on the go, your child will get the impression that you want her to do certain things but youâ€™re not really interested in what sheâ€™s going through. When she feels that, sheâ€™ll begin to shut down more and more. You have to identify with what sheâ€™s feeling even if you donâ€™t completely understand why she would feel the way she does.</p><p><br></p><p>Third, donâ€™t give your teen the third degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when your son has done something wrong you still want to communicate and not do anything to shut him down. Sometimes we can approach our kids like prosecutors cross-examining a hostile witness; and they feel that way too. Rather than pelting your son with questions like â€œwhat did you do; who was with you; donâ€™t you know better; havenâ€™t we taught you better; what were you thinking; how could you do such a thing; have you lost your mind; can I get some answers; and the like, try a more biblical approach. Gently ask your teen what happened and give him time to explain in his own words. Let him know you love him no matter what, that youâ€™ve been through similar struggles, and that you really want to help. Help him to clarify what his motives were and talk about how to think biblically about them. Help him to understand all the reasons not to do what heâ€™s done. Your teen needs to see you as a parent but he also needs to know that you are there to help by pointing him to Christ and not simply trying to come down on him.</p><p><br></p><p>Fourth, hear your teenâ€™s heart.&nbsp;</p><p>Understand what your teen is trying to say to you. Part of that is making sure you and she mean the same things with the words you are using. Ask clarifying questions. Say things like, â€œdo you mean . . . ?â€ Not only will she appreciate it but you wonâ€™t be talking past each other. You have to hear your teenâ€™s heart. She canâ€™t always say it like you would say it or even the way you would like her to say it. But she is saying something and you can work to get it. Realize the dynamic works in both directions as well. In other words, you might say, â€œI never thought you could be capable of doing such a thing. I might have thought it about your brother, but not you.â€ If you say that more than once, particularly if some time has gone by, she might interpret that to mean you donâ€™t love her or that you donâ€™t forgive her. Translation is just as important as what you say.</p><p><br></p><p>Fifth, be ready to talk when your teenager is.&nbsp;</p><p>Hectic schedules keep teens and parents separated. Your son may be ready to talk just when you were ready to read the paper or even go to bed. You might prefer to wait but the schedule may not allow it, your son may misinterpret your putting him off, he may seek an answer elsewhere, or he may not be in the mood to talk later and your opportunity will be gone forever. Rest in Godâ€™s providence and count those late night conversations as blessings, not inconveniences.</p><p>These are just a few tips. But, putting these into practice will help you and your teen to stay connected and maintain a relationship that can actually get better over time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/dr-paul-j-dean/top-five-ways-to-keep-communicating-with-your-teenager.html</p>', '9.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 08:52:58', 'Jun 30, 2021', '5-Ways-to-Open-Lines-of-Communication-with-Your-Teen', '', '2.jpg'),

Listen to music</p><p>Though it\'s probably best to avoid the really mopey Radiohead tracks, the cheering effects of music don\'t really depend on genre.

Connect with friends or family</p><p>Studies have shown that holding a spouse\'s hand reduces stress, while hearing your mom\'s voice releases similar feel-good hormones to a hug.

Connecting with loved ones can make you feel better on a chemical level, and (perhaps more importantly), remind you that you have support outside of work.</p><p><br></p><p>4.

(64, '1', '7 Things You Should Stop Expecting from Others ', '<p>The biggest disappointments in our lives are often the result of misplaced expectations.&nbsp; This is especially true when it comes to our relationships and interactions with others.</p><p>Tempering your expectations of other people will greatly reduce unnecessary frustration and suffering, in both your life and theirs, and help you refocus on the things that truly matter.</p><p>Which means itâ€™s time toâ€¦</p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to agree with you.</p><p>You deserve to be happy.&nbsp; You deserve to live a life you are excited about.&nbsp; Donâ€™t let the opinions of others make you forget that.&nbsp; You are not in this world to live up to the expectations of others, nor should you feel that others are here to live up to yours.&nbsp; In fact, the more you approve of your own decisions in life, the less approval you need from everyone else.</p><p>You have to dare to be yourself, and follow your own intuition, however frightening or strange that may feel or prove to be.&nbsp; Donâ€™t compare yourself to others.&nbsp; Donâ€™t get discouraged by their progress or success.&nbsp; Follow your own path and stay true to your own purpose.&nbsp; Success is ultimately about spending your life happily in your own way.</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to respect you more than you respect yourself.</p><p>True strength is in the soul and spirit, not in muscles.&nbsp; Itâ€™s about having faith and trust in who you are, and a willingness to act upon it.&nbsp; Decide this minute to never again beg anyone for the love, respect, and attention that you should be showing yourself.</p><p>Today, look at yourself in the mirror and say, â€œI love you, and from now on Iâ€™m going to act like it.â€&nbsp; Itâ€™s important to be nice to others, but itâ€™s even more important to be nice to yourself.&nbsp; When you practice self-love and self-respect, you give yourself the opportunity to be happy.&nbsp; When you are happy, you become a better friend, a better family member, and a better YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp; Stop expecting (and needing) them to like you.</p><p>You might feel unwanted and unworthy to one person, but you are priceless to another.&nbsp; Donâ€™t ever forget your worth.&nbsp; Spend time with those who value you.&nbsp; No matter how good you are to people, there will always be one negative person who criticizes you.&nbsp; Smile, ignore them, and carry on.</p><p>In this crazy world thatâ€™s trying to make you like everyone else, the toughest battle youâ€™ll ever have to fight is the battle to be yourself.&nbsp; And as youâ€™re fighting back, not everyone will like you.&nbsp; Sometimes people will call you names because youâ€™re â€œdifferent.â€&nbsp; But thatâ€™s perfectly OK.&nbsp; The things that make you different are the things that make YOU, and the right people will love you for it.</p><p><br></p><p>4.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to fit your idea of who they are.</p><p>Loving and respecting others means allowing them to be themselves.&nbsp; When you stop expecting people to be a certain way, you can begin to appreciate THEM.</p><p>Pay close attention, and respect people for who they are and not for who you want them to be.&nbsp; We donâ€™t know most people half as well as we believe we do; and truly knowing someone is a big part of what makes them wonderful.&nbsp; Every human being is remarkable and beautiful; it just takes a patient set of eyes to see it.&nbsp; The more you get to know someone, the more you will be able to look beyond their appearance and see the beauty of who they truly are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to know what youâ€™re thinking.</p><p>People canâ€™t read minds.&nbsp; They will never know how you feel unless you tell them.&nbsp; Your boss?&nbsp; Yeah, he doesnâ€™t know youâ€™re hoping for a promotion because you havenâ€™t told him yet.&nbsp; That cute guy you havenâ€™t talked to because youâ€™re too shy?&nbsp; Yeah, you guessed it, he hasnâ€™t given you the time of day simply because you havenâ€™t given him the time of day either.</p><p>In life, you have to communicate with others regularly and effectively.&nbsp; And often, you have to open your vocal cords and speak the first words.&nbsp; You have to tell people what youâ€™re thinking.&nbsp; Itâ€™s as simple as that.</p><p><br></p><p>6.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to suddenly change.</p><p>If thereâ€™s a specific behavior someone you care about has that youâ€™re hoping disappears over time, it probably wonâ€™t.&nbsp; If you really need them to change something, be honest and put all the cards on the table so this person knows how you feel and what you need them to do.</p><p>For the most part though, you canâ€™t change people and you shouldnâ€™t try.&nbsp; Either you accept who they are or you choose to live without them.&nbsp; It might sound harsh, but itâ€™s not.&nbsp; When you try to change people, they often remain the same, but when you donâ€™t try to change them â€“ when you support them and allow them the freedom to be as they are â€“ they gradually change in the most beautiful way.&nbsp; Because what really changes is the way you see them.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>7.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to be â€œOK.â€</p><p>Be kinder than necessary, for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle, just like you.&nbsp; Every smile or sign of strength hides an inner struggle every bit as complex and extraordinary as your own.</p><p>Remember that embracing your light doesnâ€™t mean ignoring your dark.&nbsp; We are measured by our ability to overcome adversities and insecurities, not avoid them.&nbsp; Supporting, sharing and making contributions to other people is one of lifeâ€™s greatest rewards.&nbsp; This happens naturally if we allow it, because we all share very similar dreams, needs and struggles.&nbsp; Once we accept this, the world then is a place where we can look someone else in the eye and say, â€œIâ€™m lost and struggling at the moment,â€ and they can nod and say, â€œMe too,â€ and thatâ€™s OK.&nbsp; Because not being â€œOKâ€ all the time, is perfectly OK.</p><p><br></p><p>Afterthoughts</p><p>People rarely behave exactly the way you want them to.&nbsp; Hope for the best, but expect less.&nbsp; And remember, the magnitude of your happiness will be directly proportional to your thoughts and how you choose to think about things.&nbsp; Even if a situation or relationship doesnâ€™t work out at all, itâ€™s still worth it if it made you feel something new, and if it taught you something new.</p><p><br></p><p>Your turnâ€¦</p><p>What would you add to this post?&nbsp;

(65, '1', '3 Dangerous Lies Teen Girls Believe', '<p>Is your daughter believing the lies the enemy and the world are trying to feed her?</p><p>Believing lies, in most cases, leads to disaster. Discerning the reality of the truth can be tough at any age, particularly for our kids. As our kids move into the teen years, the danger resulting from believing lies increases because it leads to toxic behavior. We need to lead them to the truth about themselves and life. In order to do that effectively, we need to identify the lies.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are going to focus on teen girls. Here are three dangerous lies teen girls believe (Note: Thankfully not all teen girls believe these lies; however, these lies do have a powerful stronghold among the majority of them):</p><p><br></p><p>1. â€œI need to look or be a certain way to be loved.â€&nbsp;</p><p>The media create an image that they say defines beauty. Immature teenage boys accept the definition and trip over each other for the girls they believe fit that description or come the closest. This only reinforces that definition of what is attractive in the minds of teen girls.</p><p>Every girl wants to fit that description because she equates that picture with being worthy of love. It is shown in every fairy tale and â€œpretty princessâ€ story she watched as a child. So she does whatever she can to fit into that mold. She is no longer satisfied with who she isâ€”only what she thinks she should be. When a girl sees she doesnâ€™t fit that mold (few actually think they do, even the popular ones), her opinion of herself drops.&nbsp;</p><p>When she believes this lie, she says to herself: â€œI need to lose weight, then people will like me. I donâ€™t fit in. Iâ€™m not worth as much as those girls. If I am myself, others wonâ€™t like me. If others know the truth about me, theyâ€™ll reject me. Iâ€™m not pretty. Iâ€™m not good at anything. Iâ€™ll never be loved.â€</p><p><br></p><p>2. â€œMy self-worth depends on the approval or attention of others.â€&nbsp;</p><p>Her entire focus becomes meeting the expectations of others. She stresses out trying to meet the approval of parents, teachers and coaches, but mainly friends and boys. When faced with disapproval or lack of attention, she ceases to feel good about herself. Eventually, she becomes more and more desperate; she goes to increasingly drastic lengths to achieve attention and approval.</p><p><br></p><p>These things can include forfeiting core beliefs, succumbing to peer pressure, using drugs or alcohol and engaging in sexual activity. When she believes this lie, she says to herself: â€œI have to be perfect. Iâ€™m not good enough. Nobody loves me. Iâ€™m worthless. If I had a boyfriend, Iâ€™d feel complete. Iâ€™m unimportant. Iâ€™m not valuable. Others think negatively about me. I must meet certain standards in order to feel good about myself. I must have the approval of certain others to feel good about myself. Iâ€™ll never be good enough. Iâ€™m stupid. I canâ€™t make good close friends.â€</p><p><br></p><p>3. â€œIâ€™m ruined.â€&nbsp;</p><p>If the last lie plays out fully and there is failure, she may buy into the lie that she is ruinedâ€”damaged goods with no possible way of recovery or wholeness. She is flooded with feelings of shame and guilt, especially when there is moral failure.</p><p>Overwhelmed and hopeless, the best way she sees to deal with the guilt and shame is to bury it down deep or numb it. Otherwise, she may also become apathetic or rebellious. When she believes this lie, she says to herself: â€œIâ€™m a failure. Those who fail are unworthy of love and deserve to be punished. Nothing matters anymore. It doesnâ€™t matter what I do anymore.â€</p><p>Be on the look out for any signs that your daughter is believing these lies. Do not let them take root in her mind and her life. Speak the truth about her beauty and value daily.</p><p>What are some truthful statements we can say to our daughters? Huddle up with your kids tonight and ask them, â€œWho makes you feel the best about yourself?â€</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.familyparliament.com/78/3-dangerous-lies-teen-girls-believe</p>', '27.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 08:59:52', 'Jun 30, 2021', '3-Dangerous-Lies-Teen-Girls-Believe', '', '2.jpg');

(66, '1', '7 Smart Ways to Deal with Toxic People', '<p>Surviving the ups, downs, and lightning storms of other peopleâ€™s moodiness can be quite a challenge.&nbsp; Itâ€™s important, though, to remember that some moody, negative people may be going through a difficult stage in their lives.&nbsp; They may be ill, chronically worried, or lacking what they need in terms of love and emotional support.&nbsp; Such people need to be listened to, supported, and cared for (although whatever the cause of their moodiness and negativity, you may still need to protect yourself from their behavior at times).</p><p>But thereâ€™s another type of moody, negative behavior: that of the toxic bully, who will use his or her mood swings to intimidate and manipulate.&nbsp; Itâ€™s this aspect of moodiness that inflicts enduring abuse and misery.&nbsp; If you observe these people closely, you will notice that their attitude is overly self-referential.&nbsp; Their relationships are prioritized according to how each one can be used to meet their selfish needs.&nbsp; This is the kind of toxic behavior I want to look at in this post.</p><p>Iâ€™m a firm believer that toxic mood swings (like chain letter emails) should not be inflicted on one person by another, under any circumstances.&nbsp; So how can you best manage the fallout from other peopleâ€™s relentless toxicity?</p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp; Move on without them.</p><p>If you know someone who insists on destructively dictating the emotional atmosphere, then be clear: they are toxic.&nbsp; If you are suffering because of their attitude, and your compassion, patience, advice, and general attentiveness doesnâ€™t seem to help them, and they donâ€™t seem to care one bit, then ask yourself, â€œDo I need this person in my life?â€</p><p>When you delete toxic people from your environment it becomes a lot easier to breathe.&nbsp; If the circumstances warrant it, leave these people behind and move on when you must.&nbsp; Seriously, be strong and know when enough is enough!&nbsp; Letting go of toxic people doesnâ€™t mean you hate them, or that you wish them harm; it simply means you care about your own well-being.</p><p>A healthy relationship is reciprocal; it should be give and take, but not in the sense that youâ€™re always giving and theyâ€™re always taking.&nbsp; If you must keep a truly toxic person in your life for whatever reason, then consider the remaining pointsâ€¦</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp; Stop pretending their toxic behavior is OK.</p><p>If youâ€™re not careful, toxic people can use their moody behavior to get preferential treatment, becauseâ€¦ wellâ€¦ it just seems easier to quiet them down than to listen to their grouchy rhetoric.&nbsp; Donâ€™t be fooled.&nbsp; Short-term ease equals long-term pain for you in a situation like this.&nbsp; Toxic people donâ€™t change if they are being rewarded for not changing.&nbsp; Decide this minute not to be influenced by their behavior.&nbsp; Stop tiptoeing around them or making special pardons for their continued belligerence.</p><p>Constant drama and negativity is never worth putting up with.&nbsp; If someone over the age 21 canâ€™t be a reasonable, reliable adult on a regular basis, itâ€™s time toâ€¦</p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp; Speak up!</p><p>Stand up for yourself.&nbsp; Some people will do anything for their own personal gain at the expense of others â€“ cut in line, take money and property, bully and belittle, pass guilt, etc.&nbsp; Do not accept this behavior.&nbsp; Most of these people know theyâ€™re doing the wrong thing and will back down surprisingly quickly when confronted.&nbsp; In most social settings people tend to keep quiet until one person speaks up, so SPEAK UP.</p><p>Some toxic people may use anger as a way of influencing you, or they may not respond to you when youâ€™re trying to communicate, or interrupt you and suddenly start speaking negatively about something dear to you.&nbsp; If ever you dare to speak up and respond adversely to their moody behavior, they may be surprised, or even outraged, that youâ€™ve trespassed onto their behavioral territory.&nbsp; But you must speak up anyway.</p><p>Not mentioning someoneâ€™s toxic behavior can become the principal reason for being sucked into their mind games.&nbsp; Challenging this kind of behavior upfront, on the other hand, will sometimes get them to realize the negative impact of their behavior.&nbsp; For instance, you might say:</p><p>â€œIâ€™ve noticed you seem angry.&nbsp; Is something upsetting you?â€</p><p>â€œI think you look bored.&nbsp; Do you think what Iâ€™m saying is unimportant?â€</p><p>â€œYour attitude is upsetting me right now.&nbsp; Is this what you want?â€</p><p>Direct statements like these can be disarming if someone truly does use their moody attitude as a means of social manipulation, and these statements can also open a door of opportunity for you to try to help them if they are genuinely facing a serious problem.</p><p>Even if they say: â€œWhat do you mean?â€ and deny it, at least youâ€™ve made them aware that their attitude has become a known issue to someone else, rather than just a personal tool they can use to manipulate others whenever they want.&nbsp;</p><p>And if they persist in denial, it might be time toâ€¦<span style=\"white-space:pre\">	</span></p><p><br></p><p>4.&nbsp; Put your foot down.</p><p>Your dignity may be attacked, ravaged and disgracefully mocked, but it can never be taken away unless you willingly surrender it.&nbsp; Itâ€™s all about finding the strength to defend your boundaries.</p><p>Demonstrate that you wonâ€™t be insulted or belittled.&nbsp; To be honest, Iâ€™ve never had much luck trying to call truly toxic people (the worst of the worst) out when theyâ€™ve continuously insulted me.&nbsp; The best response Iâ€™ve received is a snarky, â€œIâ€™m sorry you took what I said so personally.â€&nbsp; Much more effective has been ending conversations with sickening sweetness or just plain abruptness.&nbsp; The message is clear:&nbsp; There is no reward for subtle digs and no games will be played at your end.</p><p>Truly toxic people will pollute everyone around them, including you if you allow them.&nbsp; If youâ€™ve tried reasoning with them and they arenâ€™t budging, donâ€™t hesitate to vacate their space and ignore them until they do.</p><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp; Donâ€™t take their toxic behavior personally.</p><p>Itâ€™s them, not you.&nbsp; KNOW this.</p><p>Toxic people will likely try to imply that somehow youâ€™ve done something wrong.&nbsp; And because the â€œfeeling guiltyâ€ button is quite large on many of us, even the implication that we might have done something wrong can hurt our confidence and unsettle our resolve.&nbsp; Donâ€™t let this happen to you.</p><p>Remember, there is a huge amount of freedom that comes to you when you take nothing personally.&nbsp; Most toxic people behave negatively not just to you, but to everyone they interact with.&nbsp; Even when the situation seems personal â€“ even if you feel directly insulted â€“ it usually has nothing to do with you.&nbsp; What they say and do, and the opinions they have, are based entirely on their own self-reflection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>6.&nbsp; Practice practical compassion.</p><p>Sometimes it makes sense to be sympathetic with toxic people whom you know are going through a difficult time, or those who are suffering from an illness.&nbsp; Thereâ€™s no question about it, some toxic people are genuinely distressed, depressed, or even mentally and physically ill, but you still need to separate their legitimate issues from how they behave toward you.&nbsp; If you let people get away with anything because they are distressed, facing a medical condition, or depressed, even, then you are making it too tempting for them to start unconsciously using their unfortunate circumstance as a means to an end.</p><p>Several years ago, I volunteered at a psychiatric hospital for children.&nbsp; I mentored a boy there named Dennis, a diagnosed Bipolar disorder patient.&nbsp; Dennis was a handful sometimes, and would often shout obscenities at others when he experienced one of his episodes.&nbsp; But no one ever challenged his outbursts, and neither had I up to this point.&nbsp; After all, heâ€™s clinically â€œcrazyâ€ and canâ€™t help it, right?</p><p>One day I took Dennis to a local park to play catch.&nbsp; An hour into our little field trip, Dennis entered one of his episodes and began calling me profane names.&nbsp; But instead of ignoring his remarks, I said, â€œStop bullying me and calling me names.&nbsp; I know youâ€™re a nice person, and much better than that.â€&nbsp; His jaw literally dropped.&nbsp; Dennis looked stunned, and then, in a matter of seconds, he collected himself and replied, â€œIâ€™m sorry I was mean Mr. Marc.â€</p><p>The lesson here is that you canâ€™t â€œhelpâ€ someone by making unwarranted pardons for everything they do simply because they have problems.&nbsp; There are plenty of people who are going through extreme hardships who are not toxic to everyone around them.&nbsp; We can only act with genuine compassion when we set boundaries.&nbsp; Making too many pardons and allowances is not healthy or practical for anyone in the long-term.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>7.&nbsp; Take time for yourself.</p><p>If you are forced to live or work with a toxic person, then make sure you get enough alone time to relax, rest, and recuperate.&nbsp; Having to play the role of a â€œfocused, rational adultâ€ in the face of toxic moodiness can be exhausting, and if youâ€™re not careful, the toxicity can infect you.&nbsp; Again, understand that even people with legitimate problems and clinical illnesses can still comprehend that you have needs as well, which means you can politely excuse yourself when you need to.</p><p>You deserve this time away.&nbsp; You deserve to think peacefully, free from external pressure and toxic behavior.&nbsp; No problems to solve, boundaries to uphold, or personalities to please.&nbsp; Sometimes you need to make time for yourself, away from the busy world you live in that doesnâ€™t make time for you.</p><p><br></p><p>The floor is yoursâ€¦</p><p>What are your experiences with toxic people?&nbsp;

She was staring at her cell phone.</p><p>\"I thought you wanted to watch this movie?\" I asked. \"You\'re the one that asked me to stop what I was doing to watch this with you.\"</p><p>\"I\'m just multi-tasking,\" she responded matter-of-factly. \"I\'m watching with you, but I\'m also texting my friends. I can\'t not respond when they\'re texting me.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Fighting for \"Eyeball Time\"</p><p>Technology has led my wife and me into the dreaded \"also\" phase of life with our teenagers: My son wants to play a board game with me, but he also wants to play \"just one more round\" of his video game. My daughter wants to go to Starbucks, but she also wants to check her Instagram the entire time. They both want to go on the family camping trip, but they also want to have their phones in front of their faces around the campfire.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what I call fighting for \"eyeball time.\"</p><p>They are both great kids who love the Lord and have a good relationship with us. But every screen draws their attention like a cat mesmerized by a moth.

Establish a Screen-Free Time ... and Stick to It</p><p>With the exception of the previous story, family time for us is screen free. Yours can be too. One important detail with screen-free time is that everyone follows the rule. As soon as you break your own rule, your kids will be soon to follow in your footsteps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2. Be Intentional with Your Time Together</p><p>Make the time worthwhile. If you\'re asking your teen to go without their security blanket (the cell phone), then make sure the time together is something fun that will engage their attention.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Set an Example</p><p>Model it first. There is nothing worse than wanting a certain behavior from our children that we aren\'t willing to do ourselves.</p><p>When your teen is talking with you, do not answer your phone! It can wait. You only have your child\'s attention for a few minutes. Take advantage of it.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Have Fun</p><p>When your daughter is sitting on the couch looking at her Instagram, cuddle up next to her and share silly posts out loud. Let your son humiliate you in a video game. Send a text to them from across the room. I promise, they will laugh at your attempt to be hip.</p><p><br></p><p>Final Thought: Don\'t Give Up</p><p>Contrary to how it may feel, your teenager wants time with you. It\'s just that the pull of the screens can seem so much stronger at times. Don\'t give up.

(69, '1', '6 Practical Tips for Guiding Your Stressed-Out Teen', '<p>Do-or-die tests, overwhelming homework, impossible schedules, complicated relationships and looming decisions. When should you step in?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Does your teen have too much stress?</p><p>If he or she is anything like the typical teenager, the answer is a resounding yes.</p><p>Earlier this year, an American Psychological Association survey reported that teens across the U.S. have stress levels high enough to affect almost every part of their lives, with more than 27 percent saying they experience extreme stress during the school year.</p><p>A variety of physical and emotional dangersâ€”including shorter life spans than their parentsâ€”could be on the horizon if teens don\'t \"reverse their current trajectory\" of chronic illness and poor health, the report warns. But you don\'t need a survey to tell you that. If you\'re the parent of a teenager, you see first-hand the strain your teen is under.</p><p><br></p><p>Common Stressors</p><p>Sometimes stress is caused by a big event, but it may also come in small everyday stressors: homework, tests, decisions about the future, teacher problems, and relationship issues, family problems, home responsibilities, the pressure to look a certain way, being bullied, schedule overload, or the pressure to experiment with drugs, alcohol, or sex.</p><p><br></p><p>Just to name a few.</p><p>The sources of stress may vary by your teen\'s age. Early teens face rapid change as they go through puberty and navigate changing relationships with friends and the opposite sex.</p><p>They also must adjust to increased school demands. In the middle of the teen years, they may become anxious about entering high school, making top grades and getting their first jobs. Once in their older teen years they face the same stressors with the added strain of making decisions about college and a career. They may feel the pressure to succeed as adults or make adult-like decisions even though they don\'t have the life experience to do so.</p><p>Not sure if your teen is under too much stress? The best way to know is by staying involved in his or her life and watching for signs that may signal stress-things like anxiety, irritable behavior, moodiness, stomach problems or headaches, sleep issues, sadness, anger or even depression.</p><p>How can you help your teen if he or she is feeling stressed? Or better yet, how can you help prevent that stress from happening? Thankfully, there are a few things you can do.</p><p><br></p><p>1. Set a limit on your teen\'s activities.</p><p>Too many activities-even good activities-is one of the main causes of stress. Schedule overload happens when teens try to do it all: school, part-time jobs, sports teams, church activities, clubs, band, fundraisers, and dance classes. All of these activities might be good ones, but your teen most likely can\'t (and shouldn\'t have to) keep up with all of them at once.</p><p>Sit down together and have your teen write down his or her daily activities. Make up a daily schedule and see how much free time is left. Decide together what changes need to be made.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Help your teen be realistic.</p><p>If your teen is taking classes beyond his ability, the pressure will build. Or if he\'s demanding more of himself than what is healthy or possible, he\'s setting himself up for stress.</p><p>Is he working on projects beyond his ability? Trying to take part in activities that just aren\'t right for him? Taking AP classes when he\'s not ready? Help your teen develop realistic expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Work with your teen on basic problem-solving skills.</p><p>Sometimes stress is caused by many small problems left unsolved. Instead of avoiding a problem, your teen can learn to take steps to solve problems as they occur. Look at each problem, and determine what the real issue is. Then look for possible solutions. Share with your teen some problems you\'ve had and how you solved them.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Help your teen take time for fun and relaxation.</p><p>Exercise is a great stress reliever, so encourage your teen to turn off electronics and head outdoors. Plan family activities that encourage both togetherness and fitness.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Monitor your teen\'s sleep habits.</p><p>When a teen has a too-full schedule, sleep is often neglected. Because your teen is growing so quickly, she needs plenty of sleep. Find consistency in when she goes to bed and gets up each day.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Model Philippians 4:6-7.</p><p>\"Don\'t worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

Sometimes outside help is needed to get things under control. Help your teen understand that seeing a counselor isn\'t a negative thing, it\'s simply a step toward regaining the correct balance in life.</p><p><br></p><p>Stress is a natural part of life and can be used positively as a motivator. The changes in the body caused by stress actually enhance our ability to perform under pressure. So a little stress, when kept in check, can help your teenager study harder, practice smarter and work more efficiently. But too much stress over time wears a person down and leads to physical and emotional problems.</p><p>Help your teens get their stress under control and you\'ll help them live out the abundant and full life God wants for them.</p><p>Katrina Cassel</p>', '11.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:06:27', 'Jun 30, 2021', '6-Practical-Tips-for-Guiding-Your-Stressed-Out-Teen', '', '2.jpg'),
(70, '1', '5 Ways to Help a Friend With a Drug Addiction', '<p>Having a loved one struggle with a drug addiction can be overwhelming. Your desire to help absolutely comes from the right place, but it can feel impossible to know what do or how to help. Saying the wrong thing, or bringing the wrong attitude, always has the possibility to do more harm than good, since the person is most likely at a super volatile place. But the fear and concern of leaving them without support is just as real. Ultimately, if you have a friend in need and can help, you should. Still, addiction often leaves its victims separating themselves from friends entirely.</p><p>When it becomes possible to break through that distance, the right words and actions matter. Here are few steps to take when approaching and supporting a friend in need.</p><p><br></p><p>Find them when theyâ€™re sober.</p><p>If possible, avoid having conversations about your friendâ€™s need to change their behavior while theyâ€™re under the influence of drugs. People are less likely to hear the logic behind quitting while under the influence, and also tend to make promises that donâ€™t stick. Anger, poor impulse control, and irrational behavior are also possibilities. Talk to them when theyâ€™re sober for a real, honest discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>Explain your feelings.</p><p>Itâ€™s important to express real, sincere concern to start. Let your friend know that youâ€™re worried, that you love them, and that youâ€™re here for them, not you, or their image, or anything else: you just want them to be safe. Using phrases like â€œI noticed,â€ or â€œIâ€™m worriedâ€ is another recommended tactic when trying to help a friend, since your own feelings are harder to argue with, and belong totally to you. It also takes away the idea that youâ€™re the expert, which can be disputed pretty quickly by someone with an addiction, especially if youâ€™ve never been through a similar situation. Letting them know that youâ€™re concerned, rather than judgmental, is always the way to go.</p><p><br></p><p>Be specific.</p><p>Specific, unavoidable scenarios are important to discuss, and probably something your friend has been avoiding. Bringing up exact scenarios where youâ€™ve been aware of the negative impact of their addiction â€” cancelled plans, broken promises â€” can help you explain why youâ€™re worried, and fight off the urge to dispute your concern as overreacting.</p><p><br></p><p>Group intervention may be the way to go.</p><p>If you and others, such as family members, are able to openly communicate about your friendâ€™s problem, a safe, welcoming group intervention might be a possibility when confronting your friend. Just make sure youâ€™re all on the same page: youâ€™re here to help, not to blame or trap. Love and compassion can turn a room into a safe space, while anger and blame immediately make it a hostile environment for the person youâ€™re trying to help.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember that your friendâ€™s problem is the enemy, not your friend.</p><p>A person with an addiction is not a bad person. Theyâ€™re someone who has fallen into a very dark place, and they may need your help to get out. Youâ€™re here to get them to a place where theyâ€™ll be safe, healthy, and on the road to recovery. While it may be necessary to use ultimatums or be stern with your desire for them to get treatment, itâ€™s essential that you approach them with love, compassion, and the understanding that the drugs are the villain here, not your friend.</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-help-friend-drug-addiction</p>', '2.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:07:59', 'Jun 30, 2021', '5-Ways-to-Help-a-Friend-With-a-Drug-Addiction', '', '2.jpg'),
(71, '1', '5 Things Teenagers Secretly Want You to Know But Wonâ€™t Tell You', '<p>1. THEY WANT YOU TO SAY NO.</p><p>They need your boundaries, but more interestingly, they want them. Giving them clearly defined lines of what is appropriate and what is not creates security for kids. However, just because they want those boundaries doesnâ€™t mean that they arenâ€™t going to push against them and they will. Thatâ€™s how they figure out if what you say is true and real. Itâ€™s your job to say no, stick to it, and explain to them why that boundary exists. Then you need to respond with consistency, nurturing, and compassion when they step out of bounds. That is also not to say that boundaries never change or widen, particularly as they mature.</p><p><br></p><p>2. THEY ARE DESPERATE FOR YOUR APPROVAL.</p><p>Unless they perceive you as untrustworthy, this is the reason they get so annoyed and roll their eyes at your correcting. For right or wrong, they are feeling your disapproval as a person. Itâ€™s a feeling of rejection. Iâ€™m not saying to not correct, but having an awareness of how they are receiving your feedback may change how you do it and how often.</p><p><br></p><p>3. THEY WANT YOUR GUIDANCE RATHER THAN YOUR EXPECTATIONS.</p><p>They want you to walk with them in their pain and discomfort. Teenagers have adults and peers giving them marks to hit all the time. They donâ€™t need you to set a level for them to live up to but rather coach them. Itâ€™s the difference of how a football coach responds to a wide receiver who drops an easy pass. He can say, â€œI expect you to make that catch,â€ which puts pressure on the wide receiver to perform. In coaching the wide receiver, he might say, â€œWhat do you think happened on that last play? I think you may have taken your eyes off of the ball. Remember to look the ball in. I know you can do it.â€ The first is like a parent who says, â€œI expect you to get good grades, make wise decisions, and do what I say.â€ It doesnâ€™t give room for failure. A dad who gives guidance will look deeper at his daughter caught drinking and say, â€œWhat happened tonight? It seems like youâ€™re lonely and trying anything to fit in.â€</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>4. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE YET AND ARE SCARED TO DEATH.</p><p>Their core self has not developed. They really are several different people. The person they are when theyâ€™re with their friends on a Friday night is way different than the person they are at home or in the classroom. That doesnâ€™t mean they are fake, itâ€™s just a person whose different selves havenâ€™t merged into a solid identity yet. The tension they live with is trying to be both a part of themselves (which they donâ€™t know what that is) and what the other person thinks they should be. Itâ€™s a confusing and lonely place. They live in fear of disappointing people, namely, you, mom, teachers, coaches, and friends. Theyâ€™re afraid of spending the rest of their life feeling as alone and misunderstood as they do right now. Be a safe and encouraging place.</p><p><br></p><p>5. THEY ARE CONSISTENTLY TREATED WITH CONTEMPT.</p><p>If they come across as moody or oversensitive, it is more than just hormonal or a bad attitude. If I made the statement, â€œThere was a group of teenagers at the mallâ€¦,â€ you would expect the rest of that story to be negative. Teens are blamed, belittled, marginalized, and treated with contempt. Iâ€™ve seen it personally. They need to be shown respect and compassion. Donâ€™t just react (easily said I know and I am the worst offender), but study what is driving the attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.familyparliament.com/9316/5-things-teenagers-secretly-want-you-to-know-but-won-t-tell</p>', '30.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:09:01', 'Jun 30, 2021', '5-Things-Teenagers-Secretly-Want-You-to-Know-But-Wonâ€™t-Tell-You', '', '2.jpg'),
(72, '1', '10 Truths for the Teenage Girl', '<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Being a teenager is such a hard thing to be. My husband is a high school teacher, and he sometimes shares with me the latest \"teen drama\" happening in his classroom. We\'ll often laugh, but not in disbelief. More like, \"Oh yeah, I remember when I was that hormone-driven, angsty person, too.â€ The brains, emotions and bodies of teenagers are rapidly changing, leaving teens in an awkward place of feeling grown up in some ways but not at all in others. Reflecting on my own teen years, itâ€™s hard not to shake my head at the incredible mistakes I made as I waded through the process of growing up.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>How I wish I had had more older women in my life, speaking the kind of truth that Lindsee over at Living Proof Ministries shared with a 13-year-old daughter of a friend. She calls it Ten Truths for Teenage Girlsâ€”but I canâ€™t help reading her list and knowing I need reminded of these things even now, well past my teen years. Here are just a few of Lindseeâ€™s truths:</p><p><br></p><p>1. God is the author of your story, not you.</p><p>That is so much easier said than lived out, but it is the Gospel truth. He has a plan and a purpose for you that is greater than you could dream up or imagine. If you think your dreams are big, imagine how big His dreams must be for you!</p><p><br></p><p>2. You are beautiful.</p><p>I want you to hear that with fresh ears. God made you unique. He made you, you. And He made you in His image. Since you bear His image, I am praying that as people see you, they would see His face shining upon you. Beauty really is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. (Proverbs 31:30)</p><p><br></p><p>3) Know the Word.</p><p>And know what it says about you. If Iâ€™ve learned one thing, Iâ€™ve learned that if I canâ€™t always believe what I think about myself, and I canâ€™t always believe what people are saying about me or what the internet says about me,&nbsp; I can believe what the Lord says about me. I can rest in the truth of His word and the promises He gives.</p><p><br></p><p>4) Life Consists of Seasons.</p><p>Just like the four seasons come and go, so will different seasons of life come and go. Donâ€™t despair! â€œThis too shall pass.â€ is true in both sweet and bitter seasons of life. While you donâ€™t need to wish any of it away, remember to savor the sweet seasons, take the joy when it comes and stay faithful during the bitter seasons. Worship in the good times and bad. Jesus will be faithful over and over and over again. Itâ€™s in the valleys that God develops your character.</p><p><br></p><p>5) Be Humble.</p><p>At church my pastor always tells us to â€œgo lowâ€. Going low means being humble, staying humble, becoming a servant instead of searching for the spotlight. Serve, serve, serve. Invest, invest, invest in people. Never get too comfortable in your routine that you canâ€™t go out of your way to help somebody else. Work quietly with your hands and your Father in Heaven will reward your faithfulness. Be faithful in the small things. Youâ€™ll never be too good to do something â€œmeaninglessâ€.</p><p><br></p><p>6) Be bold.</p><p>In a world of social networking, we can hide behind our computer, our phones, or our iPads. Be bold. Learn how to communicate face to face. Itâ€™s a life skill thatâ€™s becoming extinct, especially to our teenagers. Refrain from posting things online that you wouldnâ€™t say to someone in person. Passive-aggressiveness (posting something for all to see when you only mean it for one to see) is not attractive.</p><p><br></p><p>7) True Love Waits.</p><p>I donâ€™t mean that in the way you hear it in church all the time. Staying pure until marriage is a gift, by all means, yes, pursue purity. Itâ€™s much harder than you think in the sex-saturated world we live in, but whether you believe it or not, itâ€™s possible. What I mean is, wait for a man that will pursue you, not confuse you. (And be careful not to be the one doing the confusing, either. We girls certainly know how to manipulate.) Wait for a man that will protect your purity, not use it. You are responsible for how you present yourself; so present yourself in a way thatâ€™s worth protecting. Sex doesnâ€™t equal love, so wait for a man that loves and respects you enough to practice restraint towards you instead of giving into temptation before marriage. Building a relationship and romance takes time, something weâ€™ve lost the art of in a world with technology at our fingertips, so donâ€™t feel pressure to rush things. Remember, before you are someoneâ€™s wife, you are first their Sister in Christ, so donâ€™t settle for less than being treated like a Sister. Your future husband will admire and value you. But also remember, there is forgiveness in Christ. You are not your past; your future spouse is not his past. The Lord redeems and renews. Praise God! But be patient in the waiting. (Thatâ€™s coming from a girl whose story is still being written. Itâ€™s not easy at all. Not one ounce is easy. But Jesus is good and He is better.)</p><p><br></p><p>8) Pursue Your Calling.</p><p>You may not know what the Lord is calling you to do today, and thatâ€™s okay. But pursuing your calling is a bold and courageous thing. Run after the things that make your heart swell. Ask questions, ask for wisdom. Be friends with those younger than you, older than you and in the same season as you. Do things you love to do. Make a plan, but keep in mind that you can make all the plans in the world, but the Lord is the one who directs each of our steps.</p><p><br></p><p>9) Your Words Matter.</p><p>Speak kind words to, in front of, and behind your friendâ€™s backs. And make sure your words and your actions line up with each other. Be honest. Be loving. Be kind. Be generous. A lady named Maya Angelou once said, â€œIâ€™ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.â€ Make people feel loved with your words and actions. In a world of email and text messaging, donâ€™t loose the wonder of snail mail.</p><p><br></p><p>10) Laugh.</p><p>You are never too old or too young to simply stop and have fun on this journey of life. Laugh until your stomach hurts. Laugh with your friends. Laugh with your family. Enjoy life Savor it. Journal about it. Talk about your experiences. Visit places you think are interesting. When all is said and done, you donâ€™t want anyone to remember you as a Negative Nelly. Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom and joy! So own that joy, live it out and share it with those around you.</p><p>You are dearly loved, my Sister in Christ. This I know, the Lord has a plan for your life that no eye has seen, no ear has heard and no mind can comprehend or imagine. Believe it. Believe that Jesus is better.</p><p>As adults, it can be easy to brush aside the challenges of those teen years, forgetting our own struggles during that time of life. Ross Campbell offers some great advice for parents on how we can really love our teens. Key to his advice: unconditional love in the face of whatever problems arise:</p><p>Teens keep coming back. No matter how much they say they dislike their parents, they need their emotional support for success. They desperately need full emotional tanks in order to feel the security and self-confidence they must have to cope with peer pressure and other demands of adolescent society. Without this confidence, teens tend to succumb to peer pressure and experience difficulty in upholding wholesome, ethical values.</p><p>Young people really need us to be there for them, building them up in the Lordâ€”reminding them of their worth, their talents, their importance to the Kingdom and the love our Heavenly Father has for each of them. (Not really so different from our own needs, right?)</p><p>What piece of encouragement would you offer a teen? Hereâ€™s a challengeâ€”find a teenager this week and share with them Lindseeâ€™s encouragement, or your own.</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/christian-trends/ten-truths-for-the-teenage-girl.html</p>', '24.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:17:40', 'Jun 30, 2021', '10-Truths-for-the-Teenage-Girl', '', '2.jpg'),
(74, '1', '10 Choices You Will Regret in 10 Years', '<p>Wearing a mask to impress others. â€“ If the face you always show the world is a mask, someday there will be nothing beneath it.&nbsp; Because when you spend too much time concentrating on everyone elseâ€™s perception of you, or who everyone else wants you to be, you eventually forget who you really are.&nbsp; So donâ€™t fear the judgments of others; you know in your heart who you are and whatâ€™s true to you.&nbsp; You donâ€™t have to be perfect to impress and inspire people.&nbsp; Let them be impressed and inspired by how you deal with your imperfections.</p><p>Letting someone else create your dreams for you. â€“ The greatest challenge in life is discovering who you are; the second greatest is being happy with what you find.&nbsp; A big part of this is your decision to stay true to your own goals and dreams.&nbsp; Do you have people who disagree with you?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; It means youâ€™re standing your ground and walking your own path.&nbsp; Sometimes youâ€™ll do things considered crazy by others, but when you catch yourself excitedly losing track of time, thatâ€™s when youâ€™ll know youâ€™re doing the right thing..</p><p>Keeping negative company. â€“ Donâ€™t let someone who has a bad attitude give it to you.&nbsp; Donâ€™t let them get to you.&nbsp; They canâ€™t pull the trigger if you donâ€™t hand them the gun.&nbsp; When you remember that keeping the company of negative people is a choice, instead of an obligation, you free yourself to keep the company of compassion instead of anger, generosity instead of greed, and patience instead of anxiety.</p><p>Being selfish and egotistical. â€“ A life filled with loving deeds and good character is the best tombstone.&nbsp; Those who you inspired and shared your love with will remember how you made them feel long after your time has expired.&nbsp; So carve your name on hearts, not stone.&nbsp; What you have done for yourself alone dies with you; what you have done for others and the world remains.</p><p>Avoiding change and growth. â€“ If you want to know your past look into your present conditions.&nbsp; If you want to know your future look into your present actions.&nbsp; You must let go of the old to make way for the new; the old way is gone, never to come back.&nbsp; If you acknowledge this right now and take steps to address it, you will position yourself for lasting success.</p><p>Giving up when the going gets tough. â€“ There are no failures, just results.&nbsp; Even if things donâ€™t unfold the way you had expected, donâ€™t be disheartened or give up.&nbsp; Learn what you can and move on.&nbsp; The one who continues to advance one step at a time will win in the end.&nbsp; Because the battle is always won far away and long before the final victory.&nbsp; Itâ€™s a process that occurs with small steps, decisions, and actions that gradually build upon each other and eventually lead to that glorious moment of triumph.</p><p>Trying to micromanage every little thing. â€“ Life should be touched, not strangled.&nbsp; Sometimes youâ€™ve got to relax and let life happen without incessant worry and micromanagement.&nbsp; Learn to let go a little before you squeeze too tight.&nbsp; Take a deep breath.&nbsp; When the dust settles and you can once again see the forest for the trees, take the next step forward.&nbsp; You donâ€™t have to know exactly where youâ€™re going to be headed somewhere great.&nbsp; Everything in life is in perfect order whether you understand it yet or not.&nbsp; It just takes some time to connect all the dots.</p><p>Settling for less than you deserve. â€“ Be strong enough to let go and wise enough to wait for what you deserve.&nbsp; Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you have ever been to stand up taller than you ever were before.&nbsp; Sometimes your eyes need to be washed by your tears so you can see the possibilities in front of you with a clearer vision again.&nbsp; Donâ€™t settle.</p><p>Endlessly waiting until tomorrow. â€“ The trouble is, you always think you have more time than you do.&nbsp; But one day you will wake up and there wonâ€™t be any more time to work on the things youâ€™ve always wanted to do.&nbsp; And at that point you either will have achieved the goals you set for yourself, or you will have a list of excuses for why you havenâ€™t..</p><p>Being lazy and wishy-washy. â€“ The world doesnâ€™t owe you anything, you owe the world something.&nbsp; So stop daydreaming and start DOING.&nbsp; Develop a backbone, not a wishbone.&nbsp; Take full responsibility for your life â€“ take control.&nbsp; You are important and you are needed.&nbsp; Itâ€™s too late to sit around and wait for somebody to do something someday.&nbsp; Someday is now; the somebody the world needs is YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.marcandangel.com/2013/01/18/10-choices-you-will-regret-in-10-years/</p>', '17.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:21:38', 'Jun 30, 2021', '10-Choices-You-Will-Regret-in-10-Years', '', '2.jpg');

So in the interest of peace and harmony, I am going to share a few things with you that you probably don\'t know in the hopes that they may help you to better tolerate us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>1. We are not perfect. We don\'t have all the answers. We don\'t even know&nbsp; all of the questions! But we do know some of the answers, we know how to find the ones that we don\'t know, and believe it or not â€” just like you know more now that you did just a few short years ago, so do we.</p><p>&nbsp;It is often said that children don\'t come with an instruction manual and there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" parenting model. Each child is different and so is each parent. Together we have to figure out how to navigate a journey that has no roadmap and no pre-determined destination.</p><p>If you are looking for a \"perfect\" parent, you are going to spend your life in eternal frustration. And you will make this relationship much more difficult than it has to be. So when we make a mistake (and we will), please try to forgive us just as we forgive you when you make mistakes. We are both, after all, only human with flaws, limitations and weaknesses. But thankfully, we both also have individual strengths and characteristics that make us interesting and likable if we would take the time to get to know one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2. We are not cool... but we used to be! I know it seems that we are so out of touch with your world. And truthfully, many of us probably are. You may even see us as boring with no capacity for humor or amusement. But we were once the rulers of our own universe.</p><p>We were artistic geniuses, star athletes, musical virtuosos, popular cheerleaders, brainiacs, techno-geeks, gifted leaders and opinion-shapers. People actually liked to be around us, sought our advice and hung on every brilliant word that came out of our mouths. We were you, your friends, the people you admire and the people that you now ridicule.</p><p>In short, \"cool\" is a relative term whose definition changes with every generation. And as hard as it is for you to believe right now, one day you too will be \"un-cool\". So go easy on us; we are still trying to figure out how we went so quickly from being on the top of the world to something you want to scrape off the bottom of your shoe!</p><p><br></p><p>3. We are evolving and growing -- just like you. We are all a work-in-progress. At each stage of our lives, we are thrown into situations we have never before experienced. And because no one likes to appear stupid or unprepared, we often make the mistake of muddling through without asking for help from someone who has gone down that path before us.</p><p>So we fall down, skin our knees, cry a little, and get back up on the bicycle of life. We live, we learn, we impact those around us, we change, we grow (and grow up) -- one experience at a time.</p><p>But hey! You are smarter than we are, aren\'t you? You do ask for advice, don\'t you? You recognize when you are on unfamiliar ground and you seek help â€” right? Surely you have learned from our mistakes! (Whew! That makes us feel so much better about leaving you in charge of your own life)!</p><p><br></p><p>4. We don\'t know what it feels like to be you (but we do know what it feels like to be your age). Even though it was eons ago, we were once your age (and it really wasn\'t as long ago as it seems). And while many things have changed, all teenagers face the big five challenges: Sex, Drugs, Alcohol, Independence and Education.</p><p>How to deal with all of these is generally where we run into problems. We don\'t always agree with one another\'s approaches to these life-changing issues. And this is where we have to ask you to go out on a limb a bit and trust our life experiences. We have walked these paths before, and we have learned a few things along the way.</p><p>So talk to us! We might actually be able to help! And since we still believe in miracles, I\'ll go out on a limb here myself and make a predictionâ€”if you will let us in on how it does feel to be you, you may just find more love, acceptance and helpful guidance than you could have ever imagined. Besides, what have you got to lose?</p><p><br></p><p>5. We are not too old to understand love, sex, and temptation. Yes, Virginia, there is Love, Sex, and Temptation after high school and college. In fact, unless you have been hiding under a rock lately, you have seen that the headlines are full of it! (Besides, how do you think you got here?)</p><p>Adults and yes, even parents (even your parents) experience deep passion and have our own moral dilemmas. We know the pain of having our hearts broken by someone we loved. We have all made some foolish choices in the name of love. We have all done things that our older, wiser and more mature selves would do differently.</p><p>We are regularly tempted to \"throw in the towel\" and move to Tahiti in pure Gauguin fashion. But we don\'t. Not because we are not tempted but because we have a greater blessing right under our noses â€” even if you are currently not speaking to us!</p><p><br></p><p>6. We have dreams, too. Inside each of us is a greater version of ourselves trying desperately to get out. Within our collective hearts we are giving birth to the great American novel, creating a work of art that will move millions to tears, building an empire that will change the world and playing the perfect game of golf, basketball, or tennis.</p><p>Just because we have become Wives, Husbands, Moms and Dads does not mean our dreams have died. They may have changed, they may even be coming true, or we may have buried them under layers of self-flagellation.</p><p>But in the innermost regions of our minds, at the core of our very being -- we dream them. For to stop dreaming is to die ourselves. And if we teach you nothing else in life, please let this one message resonate with you â€” never stop becoming a better version of yourself. Never give up on your greatest dreams for yourself. Never stop believing that you can do anything you truly love and want. When God puts a dream in your soul, He will also provide the opportunities to make that dream a reality, but only when you are truly ready.</p><p><br></p><p>7. We were also misunderstood by our parents. Do you think that you are the only teenager whose parents don\'t understand them? Au contraire, my usually wise young friend! Your Grandparents didn\'t understand your parents either.</p><p>Or is it possible, (and I am just throwing out a theory here) â€” is it possible that your parents appear not to understand you when in reality, you aren\'t sharing your hopes, dreams, innermost thoughts, fears and expectations with them?</p><p>Perhaps if you would take a leadership role here and guide your parents to a greater level of understanding, you might actually achieve more respect, independence and control because you will have educated your parents regarding your motivations, your readiness, and your ability to make wise choices. You can actually earn the right to make more decisions for yourself by earning their respect and confidence in you. Try it; you might be pleasantly surprised!</p><p><br></p><p>8. We really have gained some wisdom by our life experience. Just like you now know more than you knew when you were younger, we now know a few things that you don\'t. Life is like that. Experiences teach us, and the more experiences we have, the more we learn from them.</p><p>And since we are ancient by your standards, it is only logical that all those years of various life experiences must have had some effect on us.</p><p>Take the initiative to ask for help, ask for advice, and dare I suggest it? Ask for our opinion. By demonstrating the forethought to value someone\'s life experience above your own, you will be displaying the qualities of maturity, level-headedness, humility and resourcefulness that would impress any parent.</p><p><br></p><p>9. We are not trying to control you. We are trying to teach you, to guide you, and to help you to stay out of the potholes we stepped in ourselves. All parents want their childrens\' lives to be better than theirs. We try to protect you from pain, make the path easier to walk, and keep you safe and happy. We can\'t help it â€” it\'s a job requirement.</p><p>But you can understand that on some level, can\'t you? After all, even though you may fight with them, you also try to protect your younger siblings (or the neighborhood children) from danger. You know that the third rung on the monkey bars at the local playground has a sharp metal edge on one side. You know that because you grabbed it once and cut your hand.</p><p>Your life-experience (there\'s that word again) taught you a valuable lesson that you now feel compelled to share with someone else. In fact, you probably feel a sense of responsibility, even an obligation, to pass along the knowledge you have gained. To do less than that would be to knowingly stand by and watch someone hurt themselves, all the while possessing information that could have prevented a potential catastrophe. Who could possibly do that? Certainly not you!</p><p>And likewise, your parents cannot in good conscience, stand by and stay silent when they see a potential danger lurking up ahead in your future. They simply must try to warn you, and even go so far as to stop you when they can\'t convince you to stop yourself. It\'s their duty.</p><p>When you were younger they wouldn\'t let you walk out into the street without looking both ways. They taught you to be alert for signs of danger. They are doing the exact same thing now when they intervene in your life. You may call it \"butting in\" or \"intruding\", but they are just doing what they have always done for you â€” trying to protect you from harm.</p><p><br></p><p>10. We love you more than you think. Sometimes our rules and regulations (and the resulting conflicts that arise from them) may make you feel that we don\'t care about the things that you care about. Consequently, you may even feel that we don\'t care about you.</p><p>Nothing could be further from the truth!&nbsp; On the contrary, we care too much. We know too much. We have seen, done and experienced too much. It has made us a bit fearful for your well-being.</p><p>So at times you may think that we are unreasonable, over-reacting, and being over-protective. At times perhaps, we are (remember number one, \"We are not perfect\"?).</p><p>But parenting means erring on the side of caution. It means utilizing our knowledge, wisdom, life-experience and any other weapon in our arsenal, to keep you safe, healthy and happy. It means teaching you coping skills for when we aren\'t around to protect you. And it means that no matter what - we will always love you,&nbsp; and there will always be a piece of our heart that belongs only to you.</p><p>That is why we cry ourselves to sleep at night when you hurt our feelings or when we are worried about your choices and feel powerless to help. It is why we sometimes react negatively out of sheer fear and frustration. It is why we get angry when we can\'t seem to get you to understand. And it is why we often say, \"No\", when you are begging us to say, \"Yes\". Not because we want to be mean, to deny you the things you want in life, or to punish you.</p><p>We parent the way we do because we love you so much that we want to give you more than what you may want today. We want to give you a future that is brighter and more joyful than you can even imagine. A future that is not marred by unwise, impulsive or destructive choices. A future that doesn\'t rob you of any of your possibilities. And a future that will open the doors of opportunity for you to achieve the dreams that we know are now forming in your soul.</p><p>Being a teenager isn\'t easy. But being a parent is even harder. We pray that one day (far, far in the future) you will have this experience for yourself. But for today, we are concentrating on keeping you free of sex, drugs, and alcohol. We are trying to help you get a good education so that you will have more choices open to you in life. And we are trying to prepare you for all that independence that you so desperately want.</p><p>But here\'s a little tip that no one tells you â€” that independence comes with a price. It\'s called age! No one gains independence without getting older. And we\'ve already established that by getting older, you become less \"cool\", lose touch with what\'s going on, and generally become boring and no fun. So be careful what you wish for â€” you just might get more than you wanted! You might become old and irrelevant â€” like us!</p><p>So now that we have found some common ground â€” do you think we could finally have that hug?</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.crosswalk.com/family/parenting/10-things-every-teenager-needs-to-know-about-their-parents-11637237.html</p>', '2.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:23:45', 'Jun 30, 2021', '10-Things-Every-Teenager-Needs-to-Know-About-Their-Parents', '', '2.jpg'),

Go for long walks.&nbsp; Indulge in great conversations.&nbsp; Count your mutual blessings.&nbsp; Let go for a little while and just BE together.</p><p><br></p><p>Compulsive busyness. â€“ Schedule time every day to not be busy.&nbsp; Have dedicated downtime â€“ clear points in the day to reflect, rest, and recharge.&nbsp; Donâ€™t fool yourself; youâ€™re not so busy that you canâ€™t afford a few minutes of sanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Negative thinking about your current situation. â€“ Life is like a mirror; we get the best results when we smile.&nbsp; So talk about your blessings more than you talk about your problems.&nbsp; Just because youâ€™re struggling doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re failing.&nbsp; Every great success requires some type of worthy struggle to get there.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The needless drama around you. â€“ Be wise enough to walk away from the nonsense around you.&nbsp; Focus on the positives, and soon the negatives will be harder to see.</p><p><br></p><p>The desire for everything you donâ€™t have. â€“ No, you wonâ€™t always get exactly what you want, but remember this:&nbsp; There are lots of people who will never have what you have right now.&nbsp; The things you take for granted, someone else is praying for.&nbsp; Happiness never comes to those who donâ€™t appreciate what they already have.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Comparing yourself to everyone else. â€“ Social comparison is the thief of happiness.&nbsp; You could spend a lifetime worrying about what others have, but it wouldnâ€™t get you anything.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking about who you were or what you had in the past. â€“ Youâ€™re not the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or a week ago.&nbsp; Youâ€™re always growing.&nbsp; Experiences donâ€™t stop.&nbsp; Thatâ€™s life.</p><p><br></p><p>Worrying about the mistakes youâ€™ve made. â€“ Itâ€™s OK if you mess up; thatâ€™s how you get wiser.&nbsp; Give yourself a break.&nbsp; Donâ€™t give up.&nbsp; Great things take time, and youâ€™re getting there.&nbsp; Let your mistakes be your motivation, not your excuses.&nbsp; Decide right now that negative experiences from your past wonâ€™t predict your future.</p><p><br></p><p>Worrying about what everyone thinks and says about you. â€“ Donâ€™t take things too personally, even if it seems personal.&nbsp; Rarely do people do things because of you; they do things because of them.&nbsp; You honestly canâ€™t change how people treat you or what they say about you.&nbsp; All you can do is change how you react and who you choose to be around.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Self-deception. â€“ Your life will improve only when you take small chances.&nbsp; And the first and most difficult chance you can take is to be honest with yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>A life path that doesnâ€™t feel right. â€“ Life is to be enjoyed, not endured.&nbsp; When you truly believe in what youâ€™re doing, it shows, and it pays.&nbsp; Success in life is for those who are excited about where they are going.&nbsp; Itâ€™s about walking comfortably in your own shoes, in the direction of YOUR dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone elseâ€™s definition of success and happiness. â€“ You simply canâ€™t base your idea of success and happiness on other peopleâ€™s opinions and expectations.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Those who insist on using and manipulating you. â€“ What you allow is what will continue.&nbsp; Give as much as you can, but donâ€™t allow yourself to be used.&nbsp; Listen to others closely, but donâ€™t lose your own voice in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Trying to impress everyone. â€“ One of the most freeing things we learn in life is that we donâ€™t have to like everyone, everyone doesnâ€™t have to like us, and thatâ€™s perfectly OK.&nbsp; No matter how you live, someone will be disappointed.&nbsp; So just live your truth and be sure YOU arenâ€™t the one who is disappointed in the end.</p><p><br></p><p>All the fears holding you back. â€“ Fear is a feeling, not a fact.&nbsp; The best way to gain strength and self-confidence is to do what youâ€™re afraid to do.&nbsp; Dare to change and grow.&nbsp; In the end, there is only one thing that makes a dream completely impossible to achieve: Lack of action based on the fear of failure.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubting and second-guessing yourself. â€“ When in doubt just take the next small step.&nbsp; Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up being the biggest step of your life.</p><p><br></p><p>People who continuously dump on your dreams. â€“ Itâ€™s better to be lonely than allow negative people and their opinions derail you from your destiny.&nbsp; Donâ€™t let others crush your dreams.&nbsp; Do just once what they say you canâ€™t do, and you will never pay attention to their negativity again.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking the perfect time will come. â€“ You canâ€™t always wait for the perfect moment.&nbsp; Sometimes you must dare to do it because life is too short to wonder what could have been.</p><p><br></p><p>Band-Aids and temporary fixes. â€“ You canâ€™t change what you refuse to confront.&nbsp; You canâ€™t find peace by avoiding things.&nbsp; Deal with problems directly before they deal with your happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Close-minded judgments. â€“ Open your mind before you open your mouth.&nbsp; Donâ€™t hate what you donâ€™t know.&nbsp; The mind is like a parachute; it doesnâ€™t work when itâ€™s closed.</p><p>Other peopleâ€™s mistakes and oversights. â€“ Today, be tolerant of peopleâ€™s mistakes and oversights.&nbsp; Sometimes good people make bad choices.&nbsp; It doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re bad; it simply means they are human.</p><p><br></p><p>Resentment. â€“ Kindness is not to be mistaken for weakness, nor forgiveness for acceptance.&nbsp; Itâ€™s about knowing that resentment is not on the path to happiness.&nbsp; Remember, you donâ€™t forgive people because youâ€™re weak. You forgive them because youâ€™re strong enough to know that people make mistakes.</p><p><br></p><p>Any hateful thoughts at all. â€“ Set an example.&nbsp; Treat everyone with kindness and respect, even those who are rude to you â€“ not because they are nice, but because you are.&nbsp; Make kindness a daily ritual; itâ€™s what makes life happier and more fulfilling in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p>Regrets of any kind. â€“ You donâ€™t have to be defined by the things you once did or didnâ€™t do.&nbsp; Donâ€™t let yourself be controlled by regret.&nbsp; Maybe thereâ€™s something you could have done differently, or maybe not.&nbsp; Either way, itâ€™s merely something that has already happened.&nbsp; Leave the unchangeable past behind you as you give yourself to the present moment.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Every point in time other than right now. â€“ Donâ€™t cry over the past, itâ€™s gone.&nbsp; Donâ€™t stress too much about the future, it hasnâ€™t arrived.&nbsp; Do your best to live NOW and make this moment worth living.</p><p><br></p><p>Your turnâ€¦</p><p>Truth be told, the most important decision you will ever make is what you do with the time that is given to you.&nbsp; So letâ€™s revisit the question I proposed in the intro:&nbsp; What do you need to stop wasting time on?</p><p>Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.</p><p>WRITTEN by MARC CHERNOFF</p>', '4.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:25:49', 'Jun 30, 2021', '25-Things-You-Need-to-Stop-Wasting-Time-On', '', '2.jpg'),
(77, '1', '18 Things I Wish Someone Told Me When I Was 18', '<p>This morning I was reading a book at my favorite beach-side coffee shop when an 18-year-old kid sat down next to me and said, â€œThatâ€™s a great read, ainâ€™t it?â€&nbsp; So we started chatting.</p><p>He told me he was getting ready to graduate from high school in a couple of weeks and then immediately starting his college career in the fall.&nbsp; â€œBut I have no clue what I want to do with my life,â€ he said.&nbsp; â€œRight now Iâ€™m just going with the flow.â€</p><p>And then, with eager, honest eyes, he began asking me one question after the next:</p><p>â€œWhat do you do for a living?â€</p><p>â€œWhen and how did you decide what you wanted to do?â€</p><p>â€œWhy did you do this?&nbsp; Why didnâ€™t you do that?â€</p><p>â€œIs there anything you wish you had done differently?â€</p><p>Etc, etc, etcâ€¦</p><p>I answered his questions as best as I could, and tried to give decent advice with the time I had.&nbsp; And after a half-hour conversation, he thanked me and we parted ways.</p><p>But on the walk home I realized the conversation I had with him was actually quite nostalgic for me.&nbsp; He reminded me of me ten years ago.&nbsp; So I started thinking about his questions again, and I began imagining all of the things I wish someone had told me when I was 18.</p><p>Then I took it a step further and thought about all the things I would love to tell myself if I could travel back in time to give my 18-year-old self some advice about life.</p><p>So after a few cups of coffee and a couple hours of deliberation, here are 18 things I wish someone told me when I was 18:</p><p>Commit yourself to making lots of mistakes. â€“ Mistakes teach you important lessons.&nbsp; The biggest mistake you can make is doing nothing because youâ€™re too scared to make a mistake.&nbsp; So donâ€™t hesitate â€“ donâ€™t doubt yourself.&nbsp; In life, itâ€™s rarely about getting a chance; itâ€™s about taking a chance.&nbsp; Youâ€™ll never be 100% sure it will work, but you can always be 100% sure doing nothing wonâ€™t work.&nbsp; Most of the time you just have to go for it!&nbsp; And no matter how it turns out, it always ends up just the way it should be.&nbsp; Either you succeed or you learn something.&nbsp; Win-Win.&nbsp; Remember, if you never act, you will never know for sure, and you will be left standing in the same spot forever.</p><p>Find hard work you love doing. â€“ If I could offer my 18-year-old self some real career advice, Iâ€™d tell myself not to base my career choice on other peopleâ€™s ideas, goals and recommendations.&nbsp; Iâ€™d tell myself not to pick a major because itâ€™s popular, or statistically creates graduates who make the most money.&nbsp; Iâ€™d tell myself that the right career choice is based on one key point: Finding hard work you love doing.&nbsp; As long as you remain true to yourself, and follow your own interests and values, you can find success through passion.&nbsp; Perhaps more importantly, you wonâ€™t wake up several years later working in a career field you despise, wondering â€œHow the heck am I going to do this for the next 30 years?â€&nbsp; So if you catch yourself working hard and loving every minute of it, donâ€™t stop.&nbsp; Youâ€™re on to something big.&nbsp; Because hard work ainâ€™t hard when you concentrate on your passions.</p><p>Invest time, energy and money in yourself every day. â€“ When you invest in yourself, you can never lose, and over time you will change the trajectory of your life.&nbsp; You are simply the product of what you know.&nbsp; The more time, energy and money you spend acquiring pertinent knowledge, the more control you have over your life.</p><p>Explore new ideas and opportunities often. â€“ Your natural human fears of failure and embarrassment will sometimes stop you from trying new things.&nbsp; But you must rise above these fears, for your lifeâ€™s story is simply the culmination many small, unique experiences.&nbsp; And the more unique experiences you have, the more interesting your story gets.&nbsp; So seek as many new life experiences as possible and be sure to share them with the people you care about.&nbsp; Not doing so is not living.</p><p>When sharpening your career skills, focus more on less. â€“ Think in terms of Karate: A black belt seems far more impressive than a brown belt.&nbsp; But does a brown belt really seem any more impressive than a red belt?&nbsp; Probably not to most people.&nbsp; Remember that society elevates experts high onto a pedestal.&nbsp; Hard work matters, but not if itâ€™s scattered in diverse directions.&nbsp; So narrow your focus on learning fewer career related skills and master them all.</p><p>People are not mind readers.&nbsp; Tell them what youâ€™re thinking.â€“ People will never know how you feel unless you tell them.&nbsp; Your boss?&nbsp; Yeah, he doesnâ€™t know youâ€™re hoping for a promotion because you havenâ€™t told him yet.&nbsp; That cute girl you havenâ€™t talked to because youâ€™re too shy?&nbsp; Yeah, you guessed it; she hasnâ€™t given you the time of day simply because you havenâ€™t given her the time of day either.&nbsp; &nbsp;In life, you have to communicate with others.&nbsp; And often, you have to open your vocal cords and speak the first words.&nbsp; You have to tell people what youâ€™re thinking.&nbsp; Itâ€™s as simple as that.</p><p>Make swift decisions and take immediate action. â€“ Either youâ€™re going to take action and seize new opportunities, or someone else will first.&nbsp; You canâ€™t change anything or make any sort of progress by sitting back and thinking about it.&nbsp; Remember, thereâ€™s a huge difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it.&nbsp; Knowledge is basically useless without action.</p><p>Accept and embrace change. â€“ However good or bad a situation is now, it will change.&nbsp; Thatâ€™s the one thing you can count on.&nbsp; So embrace change, and realize that change happens for a reason.&nbsp; It wonâ€™t always be easy or obvious at first, but in the end it will be worth it.</p><p>Donâ€™t worry too much about what other people think about you. â€“ For the most part, what other people think and say about you doesnâ€™t matter.&nbsp; When I was 18, I let the opinions of my high school and early college peers influence my decisions.&nbsp; And, at times, they steered me away from ideas and goals I strongly believed in.&nbsp; I realize now, ten years later, that this was a foolish way to live, especially when I consider that nearly all of these people whose opinions I cared so much about are no longer a part of my life.&nbsp; Unless youâ€™re trying to make a great first impression (job interview, first date, etc.), donâ€™t let the opinions of others stand in your way.&nbsp; What they think and say about you isnâ€™t important.&nbsp; What is important is how you feel about yourself.</p><p>Always be honest with yourself and others. â€“ Living a life of honesty creates peace of mind, and peace of mind is priceless.&nbsp; Period.</p><p>Talk to lots of people in college and early on in your career.&nbsp; Bosses.&nbsp; Colleagues.&nbsp; Professors.&nbsp; Classmates.&nbsp; Social club members.&nbsp; Other students outside of your major or social circle. Teaching assistants.&nbsp; Career advisors.&nbsp; College deans.&nbsp; Friends of friends.&nbsp; Everyone!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Professional networking.&nbsp; I have worked for three employers since I graduated from college (I left my first two employers by choice on good terms), but I only interviewed with the first employer.&nbsp; The other two employers offered me a job before I even had a formal interview, based strictly on the recommendation of a hiring manager (someone I had networked with over the years).&nbsp; When employers look to fill a position, the first thing they do is ask the people they know and trust if they know someone who would do well in the position.&nbsp; If you start building your professional network early, youâ€™ll be set.&nbsp; Over time, youâ€™ll continue talking to new people you meet through your current network and your networkâ€™s reach and the associated opportunities will continue to snowball for the duration of your career.</p><p>Sit alone in silence for at least ten minutes every day. â€“ Use this time to think, plan, reflect, and dream.&nbsp; Creative and productive thinking flourish in solitude and silence.&nbsp; With quiet, you can hear your thoughts, you can reach deep within yourself, and you can focus on mapping out the next logical, productive step in your life.</p><p>Ask lots of questions. â€“ The greatest â€˜adventureâ€™ is the ability to inquire, to ask questions.&nbsp; Sometimes in the process of inquiry, the search is more significant than the answers.&nbsp; Answers come from other people, from the universe of knowledge and history, and from the intuition and deep wisdom inside yourself.&nbsp; These answers will never surface if you never ask the right questions.&nbsp; Thus, the simple act of asking the right questions is the answer.</p><p>Exploit the resources you do have access to. â€“ The average person is usually astonished when they see a physically handicap person show intense signs of emotional happiness.&nbsp; How could someone in such a restricted physical state be so happy?&nbsp; The answer rests in how they use the resources they do have.&nbsp; Stevie Wonder couldnâ€™t see, so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music, and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it.</p><p>Live below your means. â€“ Live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one.&nbsp; Do not spend to impress others.&nbsp; Do not live life trying to fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects.&nbsp; Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you.&nbsp; Always live well below your means.</p><p>Be respectful of others and make them feel good. â€“ In life and business, itâ€™s not so much what you say that counts, itâ€™ how you make people feel.&nbsp; So respect your elders, minors, and everyone in between.&nbsp; There are no boundaries or classes that define a group of people that deserve to be respected.&nbsp; Treat everyone with the same level of respect you would give to your grandfather and the same level of patience you would have with your baby brother.&nbsp; Supporting, guiding, and making contributions to other people is one of lifeâ€™s greatest rewards.&nbsp; In order to get, you have to give.</p><p>Excel at what you do. â€“ Thereâ€™s no point in doing something if you arenâ€™t going to do it right.&nbsp; Excel at your work and excel at your hobbies.&nbsp; Develop a reputation for yourself, a reputation for consistent excellence.</p><p>Be who you were born to be. â€“ You must follow your heart, and be who you were born to be.&nbsp; Some of us were born to be musicians â€“ to communicate intricate thoughts and rousing feelings with the strings of a guitar.&nbsp; Some of us were born to be poets â€“ to touch peopleâ€™s hearts with exquisite prose.&nbsp; Some of us were born to be entrepreneurs â€“ to create growth and opportunity where others saw rubbish.&nbsp; And still, some of us were born to be or do whatever it is, specifically, that moves you.&nbsp; Regardless of what you decide to do in your lifetime, you better feel it in every fiber of your being.&nbsp; You better be born to do it!&nbsp; Donâ€™t waste your life fulfilling someone elseâ€™s dreams and desires.</p><p>But above all, laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you canâ€™t change.&nbsp; Life is short, yet amazing.&nbsp; Enjoy the ride.</p><p>Also, if you liked this article and youâ€™re looking for similar advice on life, love and personal growth I highly recommend that you read The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck.&nbsp; Itâ€™s an easy, enjoyable read that literally changed my life.</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/06/21/18-things-i-wish-someone-told-me-when-i-was-18/</p>', '16.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:29:00', 'Jun 30, 2021', '18-Things-I-Wish-Someone-Told-Me-When-I-Was-18', '', '2.jpg'),

Of course, we all find this incredibly easy to do, right? WRONG!</p><p><br></p><p>This feels completely impossible most (maybe all) of the time. If there is one area of life where it feels like Satan is winning the battle, itâ€™s in the area of sex. And if there is one area where our bodies are screaming out to us to disobey God, itâ€™s in the area of sex.</p><p><br></p><p>So I want to give you my top 20 tips to help you avoid sexual immorality:</p><p><br></p><p>Find out what pleases the Lord. This is a command straight out of Ephesians 5:10, and is part of what it means to live a life worthy of our calling as Christians, and part of what it means to live a life of love, just as Christ loved us.</p><p><br></p><p>Find out what Godâ€™s will for your life is. 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 says,â€œIt is Godâ€™s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God;â€ It doesnâ€™t get much clearer than that!</p><p><br></p><p>The battle begins in the mind. You need to know what God says about sex and trust what God says about sex. You need to be careful what you fill your minds with. Imagination is often the hot-bed where sin is hatched. Martin Luther once said about sexual desires, â€œYou canâ€™t stop birds from flying over your head, but you can stop them from making nests in your hair.â€</p><p><br></p><p>Pray (It is a spiritual battle too). Depend on God, on the power of His Holy Spirit to strengthen you in this battle. (Matthew 6:13; 2 Timothy 2:22; James 5:16)</p><p><br></p><p>Don\'t put yourself in situations where you will be easily tempted. There is little point praying that God would not lead you into temptation, then walking straight into a tempting situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember God is watching. You are never completely out of sight. Someone can always see you.</p><p><br></p><p>Wield the axe. Jesus says in Matthew 5, if your eye or hand causes you to sin, gouge them out and throw them away, because eternal life is at stake. So if the internet, magazines, TV, or peer groups are causing you to sin; wield the axe. Chop away those things that tempt you.</p><p><br></p><p>Talk about sex (accountability). You can\'t fight this alone. You need God\'s help and you need help from God\'s people too.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not alone. It can be helpful to know you are not the only person who has ever been tempted this way. â€œNo temptation has seized you except what is common to manâ€ (1 Corinthians 10:13a)</p><p><br></p><p>You CAN resist. \"God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear\" (1 Corinthians 10:13b).</p><p><br></p><p>Know that God provides a way out. \"But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it\" (1 Corinthians 10:13c).</p><p><br></p><p>Count yourself dead to sin and alive to God. Christians are people who have died to sin (knowing that sin leads to death), and now live for God and righteousness, knowing that this leads to eternal life (Romans 6:11-14).</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the cross. Jesus died for our sins, including our sexual sins.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember Jesus is coming back. We will all have to give an account for our lives, even our sex life.</p><p><br></p><p>Memorise Scripture. When Jesus was tempted in the desert, he fired Scripture back at the devil (Matthew 4:1-11). Having Godâ€™s Word in the forefront of your mind can help you too.</p><p><br></p><p>Weariness and sadness often leads to sin. Learn to know yourself. Know when you are weak and susceptible to temptation.</p><p><br></p><p>Struggling is a good sign. Keep fighting and don\'t give in.</p><p><br></p><p>Be careful what you wear. Modesty is good for you and good for others too.</p><p><br></p><p>Forgiveness is available. If you sin sexually you can still be forgiven, such is the power of the cross of Christ. So repent, turn back to God and live for Him.</p><p><br></p><p>Read some good books. Fervr recently released Teen Sex By the Book. You might find it a helpful guide for answering some of your questions about sex.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope and pray that these tips will help you in this fight.

That means you need to be your teen\'s greatest champion. Here are 12 ways to cheer him on.</p><p><br></p><p>Encourage proper identity</p><p>Teens experience pressure to succeed at an early age. As a result, they can grow discouraged or feel like they can\'t measure up to our hopes or their own goals. Encourage your teen to base her self-worth on who she is in Christ, not what she does. Let her relationship with Christ be her chief identifier.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen</p><p>As parents, we often talk \"at\" our teens rather than taking the time to listen to them. Cultivate the art of listening. Avoid formulating a mental comeback while your teen is speaking, but really listen to discern fears and emotions behind his words. Let your teen know you are available any time she wants to talk.</p><p><br></p><p>Validate feelings and opinions</p><p>It\'s really hard to live in a house where opinions aren\'t valued and where you\'re not allowed to express emotion. Consider having family forums - times of discussion that involve all family members. Let each family member have a voice.</p><p><br></p><p>Console and comfort</p><p>Your teen may be having some emotional battles at school or in relationships. Each teen faces these challenges differently. Remember that what seems insignificant to you could be a crisis to her.</p><p><br></p><p>Notice strengths and downplay weaknesses</p><p>It\'s easy to view life critically, constantly pointing out the negatives and rarely recognizing the good. Not only does this undermine self-worth, but it also models a critical spirit they are likely to adopt as adults. Instead, compliment the things he is going right.</p><p><br></p><p>Bless with touch</p><p>As children grow, we tend to stop touching them. This creates distance, and they wonder if they still matter. Just because your teen is older doesn\'t mean she no longer needs your touch.</p><p><br></p><p>Pray aloud</p><p>Nothing makes a teen feel more special than hearing his parents pray for him. Avoid using prayers to address problems in a round-about way. Let your prayers be affirming and filled with blessings and gratitude for your teen.</p><p><br></p><p>Discover spiritual gifts</p><p>Helping your teen discover her spiritual gifts is a great way to boost her self-esteem. Your church may even provide an assessment of spiritual strengths.</p><p><br></p><p>Cultivate a sense of heritage</p><p>Feeling a connection to \"roots\" (both genetically and spiritually) helps teens develop a sense of identity and enhances self-worth. Share strengths, weaknesses, and spiritual stories from your family in an effort to teach and train your teen.</p><p><br></p><p>Provide decision-making opportunities</p><p>Teens learn by making decisions and experiencing consequences. Providing your teen with decision-making opportunities sends the message that you trust him. After all, it\'s better to let him test his decision-making skills at home than later at college.</p><p><br></p><p>Don\'t harp on body image</p><p>The world sends the message that unless you are one of the \"beautiful people\" you are no one. Help your teen build a sense of self-worth from something other than what her body looks like. Model healthy eating and exercise habits, but resist the urge to criticize your own body or your teen\'s.</p><p><br></p><p>Say \'I love you\' often and mean it</p><p>Let every greeting and every parting include an \"I love you,\" even when you are angry with your teen. Regardless of the circumstances, these teens are a precious heritage and a gift from God.</p><p>Try some of these words of affirmation with your teen.</p><p>\"I appreciate you because...\"</p><p>\"I was pleased to see you...\"</p><p>\"I want to thank you for...\"</p><p>\"You blessed me when...\"</p><p>Your verbal praise will raise your teen\'s sense of self-worth.</p><p>Candy Arrington&nbsp;</p>', '31.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:46:56', 'Jun 30, 2021', '12-Ways-to-Instill-Self-Worth-in-Your-Teen', '', '2.jpg');

Fake friends are always out there and theyâ€™re detrimental towards your environment and well-being.</p><p>Fake friends are not real, meaning they donâ€™t give a fuck about you or their friendship with you. Theyâ€™ll make use of you and annoy the hell out of you.</p><p>Two things will happen when you hang out with fake friends:</p><p>The first is that you guys will eventually not have a friendship at all because youâ€™re either sick of his shit or heâ€™d disappear with your shit.</p><p>The second is that the fake person grows up and changes for the better, which by then is honestly probably not worth it at all because youâ€™d have suffered years of his bullshit.</p><p>Iâ€™ve had fake friends before and whenever I look back, I wonder why I put up with so much nonsense especially since they were nothing but pathetic losers.</p><p>Check the 11 signs. Take note and start doing something about it.</p><p><br></p><p>11 SIGNS YOUâ€™RE HANGING OUT WITH A FAKE FRIEND</p><p><br></p><p>1) The fake friend always uses specific, choice words to make you feel good for no real reason.</p><p>And itâ€™s all nothing but flowery bullshit especially since a normal human would use simple words.</p><p>â€œI couldnâ€™t have done it without youâ€ comes to mind. A friend told me this once. Done what? Something super easy and mundane. Donâ€™t fall for this bullshit.</p><p>Another one would be, â€œI actually considered you for the roleâ€. Noticed how talk is created after all is already actually said and done. Hence, notice how talk is cheap?</p><p>The fake friend exploits this. He knows that words are easy to make and can be used to manipulate unassuming people.</p><p><br></p><p>2) The morning after the fake friend gets seriously drunk, heâ€™d remember the things that went his way. He will conveniently not be able to remember the annoying shit he does</p><p>A friend and I experimented with this when we were younger.</p><p>We didnâ€™t bother sending a drunk friend home once. The next day, he was very angry that we didnâ€™t look out for him.</p><p>The times we put up with him and told him the annoying shit he did? Heâ€™d be like, â€œHaha oh my god! I was drunk! I so donâ€™t remember anything! Iâ€™m so cute and funny!â€</p><p>Well he didnâ€™t actually say that, but he certainly ravelled in the attention.</p><p>The idea of not remembering the night before when youâ€™re drunk is absolute bullshit. Even though youâ€™re drunk, youâ€™re still able to make conscious decisions. I know so from real, first hand experience. You canâ€™t remember the smaller details, but you can still recall most of the night.</p><p>If you have a friend whoâ€™s constantly getting drunk and making use of that, heâ€™s a fake. Steer clear. Just do a disappearing act when he has had imbibe too much.</p><p><br></p><p>3) The fake friend spins a tale out of his otherwise simple ass job</p><p>I once went out with an extremely pretentious girl who described her job as, â€œIâ€™m in charge of making calls to potential clients. It is up to me to keep gathering prospects for the company so that deals can be closed. A lot of money is involved.â€</p><p>Bitch was just a telemarketer. She made $8/hr.</p><p>Work is important. Everybody has to work, but only the fake people see the need to show how important their work is to others. Thatâ€™s when they start embellishing everything if their job truly sucks.</p><p>Or, if their job is pretty prestigious and commands a high salary, theyâ€™d only be talking about work most of the time. Thatâ€™s when they shamelessly try to compare salaries, number of hours worked or what cars everybody drive.</p><p>Do you see how the fake friend only looks at people as a set of status and numbers?</p><p><br></p><p>4) The fake friend studies extremely hard to be current with the news</p><p>That way, he or she can appear sophisticated, when theyâ€™re not. They also do this to try to fit in with a different crowd.</p><p>Ever had a friend whoâ€™s not into politics, but at the bar he seems to very well-versed in a couple of lines and names? He did his homework.</p><p>This happened to me once. The girl I was with recited the same, exact line to two different groups on some current news piece on that day itself.</p><p>A fake friend will never care about deeper issues like, you know, passion, personality and stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>5) The fake friend always exaggerates everything and borders on lying to make himself look good</p><p>That is when youâ€™re like, â€œHey, thatâ€™s not what happened.â€</p><p>And then he turns the whole group against you as he makes the joke about you.</p><p>This happens way too often to many people, but we tend to brush it off even though it actually bothers us.</p><p>Donâ€™t put up with this shit, especially if the jokeâ€™s on you. Thereâ€™s a limit to how much noise an empty vessel should make. Donâ€™t make up excuses for a friend. Be with friends you donâ€™t have to question at all.</p><p><br></p><p>6) The fake friend NEVER follows up on anything</p><p>Because he knows talk is cheap. And his weak character isnâ€™t brave enough for real talk.</p><p>This is why fake people are so good at disappearing acts or coming up with a ton of excuses. Promises will be broken and youâ€™ll be left it in the lurch.</p><p>If you noticed, the fake friend usually talks the most during social situations with alcohol present. Itâ€™s just way too easy to put on a positive front when everybody is drinking.</p><p><br></p><p>7) A fake friend is a broke friend</p><p>Because heâ€™s all, â€œBlah blah blahâ€ and then, â€œCould you lend me twenty bucks?â€</p><p>Or, â€œI got this manâ€ then disappears when the bill arrives.</p><p>He will never pay back. The fake friend is not ready for the real world and will never get off his ass to get a job.</p><p><br></p><p>8) The fake friend makes it easy</p><p>Come on man. Deep down you know your friend is fake. Itâ€™s that nagging feeling telling you that your friend really isnâ€™t your friend.</p><p>â€œHe annoys meâ€, â€œI guess I can tolerate him a bit moreâ€¦â€, â€œOh heâ€™s actually a good guyâ€ or â€œIâ€™m not sure why I always hang out with him, but oh wellâ€ come to mind.</p><p>The signs are all there. No one is dumb enough to not see it. But because you want to seem like a good person, you justify way too much for the fake friend; you always give the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>That being said, the fake friend is hence also dumb because he thinks he can get away with it.</p><p><br></p><p>9) There is always ambiguous shit-talking behind your back</p><p>Ever been in a social circle where everyone is always willing to tell you who said what about someone? And then it eventually leads to you?</p><p>Somebody would probably start with, â€œHey man, I heard he said that about youâ€ or â€œOh what do you think of him? and eventually, youâ€™d be accused, â€œI heard you were talking shit behind my back?â€</p><p>Or more laughably, â€œWhy did you tell everybody my secret?â€ when obviously, the fake friend was telling the whole world his â€œsecret.â€</p><p>If youâ€™re in such a circle, guess what? All your friends are fake. Theyâ€™re only alive because of the gossip.</p><p><br></p><p>10) The fake friend is overly nice to everybody</p><p>Being nice is cool. Being overly nice is not. Itâ€™s common sense.</p><p>You just know that thereâ€™s a chock full of hidden agendas somewhere there.</p><p>Iâ€™m not just talking about people who are only being nice to get a favour in return, but do you see that overly nice people fall under not following up on anything?</p><p>Perhaps they lack the balls to say no, but whatever it is, the fake friend has crossed the line into becoming fake as they donâ€™t know the consequences of being a Yes Man to everyone as they think they can get away with being nice through words only.</p><p><br></p><p>11) You have friends, but you feel like you donâ€™t</p><p>It doesnâ€™t matter how many likes you get, how many followers you have or even how many people you see everyday.</p><p>When you feel alone while being with people, something is wrong.</p><p>When you have to sigh and shake your head whenever somebody tells you something, something is wrong.</p><p>When youâ€™re unwilling to do somebody a favour because you feel they donâ€™t deserve it, something is wrong.</p><p>When you in need of help and your â€œfriendsâ€ are nowhere to be found, something is definitely wrong.</p><p>Best to change the environment. Itâ€™s fake.

Here are some warning signs youâ€™re in the presence of the latter:</p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp; They only make time for you when itâ€™s convenient for them.</p><p>Itâ€™s obvious, but any relationship without regular interaction and communication is going to have problems, especially when thereâ€™s a lack of commitment.</p><p>Donâ€™t waste your time with someone who only wants you around when itâ€™s convenient for them.&nbsp; You shouldnâ€™t have to force someone to make a space in their life for you, because if they truly care about you they will gladly create space for you.</p><p>Being in a relationship with someone who overlooks your worth isnâ€™t loyalty, itâ€™s stupidity.&nbsp; Never beg someone for attention.&nbsp; Know your self-worth, and move on if you must.</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp; They hold your past against you.</p><p>Some people will refuse to accept that you are no longer who you used to be â€“ that youâ€™ve made mistakes in the past, learned from them, and moved past them.&nbsp; They may not be able to stand the fact that youâ€™re growing and moving on with your life, and so they will try to drag your past to catch up with you.&nbsp; Do not help them by acknowledging their negative behavior.&nbsp; Keep moving forward.</p><p>Holding on to the unchangeable past is a waste of energy and serves no purpose in creating a better day today.&nbsp; If someone continuously judges you by your past and holds it against you, you might have to repair your future by leaving them behind.</p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp; You feel trapped.</p><p>Healthy relationships keep the doors and windows wide open.&nbsp; Plenty of air is flowing and no one feels trapped.&nbsp; Relationships thrive in this kind of unrestricted environment.&nbsp; You can come and go as you please, but you choose to stay because where you are is where you want to be.</p><p>If you want to be a part of someoneâ€™s life, all the open doors and windows in the world wonâ€™t make you leave.&nbsp; If someone has closed them all in an effort to trap you into something you donâ€™t want to be a part of, itâ€™s time to find the strength to kick down the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>4.&nbsp; They discredit your dreams and abilities.</p><p>If you allow others to define your dreams and abilities, then you enable them to hold you back.&nbsp; What youâ€™re capable of achieving is not a function of what other people think is possible for you.&nbsp; What youâ€™re capable of achieving depends on what you choose to do with your time and energy.</p><p>People will throw all sorts of assumptions your way about what is possible and what is impossible.&nbsp; Look beyond the presumptions and mental limitations of others, and connect with your own best vision of how YOUR life can be.&nbsp; Life is an open-ended journey, and what you achieve comes from what you expect to achieve and what you work to achieve.</p><p>So donâ€™t worry about what everyone else thinks.&nbsp; Keep living your truth.&nbsp; The only people that will get mad at you for doing so are those who want you to live a lie.</p><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp; They have lied to you more than once.</p><p>Love is a verb, not a noun.&nbsp; It is ACTIVE in all relationships.&nbsp; Love is not just feelings of passion and romance between lovers; it is also a behavior among friends and family.&nbsp; If someone lies to you, they are unlovingly disrespecting you and your relationship.</p><p>When you keep someone in your life who is a chronic liar, and you keep giving them new chances to be trusted, you have a lot in common with this person â€“ youâ€™re both lying and being unloving to you!</p><p>Bottom line:&nbsp; Those who avoid the truth and tell you only what you want to hear do so for their own benefit, not yours.&nbsp; Donâ€™t put up with it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>6.&nbsp; Their negativity is rubbing off on you.</p><p>The negative people in your life donâ€™t just behave negatively towards you, but towards everyone they interact with.&nbsp; What they say and do is a projection of their own reality â€“ their own inner issues.&nbsp; Even if they say something to you that seems personal â€“ even if they insult you directly â€“ it likely has zero to do with you.</p><p>This is important to remember because what these negative people say and do shouldnâ€™t be taken to heart.&nbsp; Although you donâ€™t have control over what they say and do; you do have control over whether or not you allow them to say and do these things to you.&nbsp; You alone can deny their venomous words and actions from invading your heart and mind.&nbsp; If you feel like these people are getting to you, take a break and give yourself some space to breathe.</p><p>Positive things happen when you distance yourself from negative people.&nbsp; Doing so doesnâ€™t mean you hate them, it simply means you respect yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are excessively envious of what you have.</p><p>A little bit of envy is OK, but when someone is excessively envious of what you have, thereâ€™s a good chance what they really want is to take it from you.</p><p>Excessive envy doesnâ€™t tell you how much someone admires you, it tells you how much they dislike themselves.&nbsp; If you can, try to help lift them up, but also be careful that they donâ€™t pull you down.&nbsp; Oftentimes no amount of love, or promises, or proof from you will ever be enough to make them feel better about themselves.&nbsp; For the broken pieces they carry, are pieces they must mend for themselves.&nbsp; Happiness, after all, is an inside job.</p><p><br></p><p>8.&nbsp; They motivate you to be judgmental or hateful.</p><p>Truth be told, no human being is superior.&nbsp; No faith, race, size or shape is inferior.&nbsp; All collective judgments about others are wrong.&nbsp; Only judgmental hypocrites make them.</p><p>If you judge others by their skin color, their body size, and their outer beauty, you will miss EVERYTHING about who they really are.&nbsp; It is amazing the quality of people you will learn about and meet in this world if you can simply get past the fact that lots of people are not dressing and living the way you do.</p><p>People who motivate you to judge or hate others are as bad as bad company gets.&nbsp; Avoid them at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>9.&nbsp; They want you to be someone else.</p><p>Spend time with people who see you the way you are, and not as they wish to think you are.&nbsp; Spend even more time with those who truly know about you, and who love and respect you anyway.</p><p>If someone expects you to be someone youâ€™re not, take a step back.&nbsp; Itâ€™s wiser to lose relationships over being who you are, than to keep them intact by acting like someone youâ€™re not.&nbsp; Itâ€™s easier to nurse a little heartache and meet someone new, than it is to piece together your own shattered identity.&nbsp; Itâ€™s easier to fill an empty space within your life where someone else used to be, than it is to fill the empty space within yourself where YOU used to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Your turnâ€¦</p><p>What would you add to the list?&nbsp;

(82, '1', '10 TIPS ON HOW TO LOVE YOURSELF EVEN MORE', '<p>You quite often hear people saying things like: â€˜You have to love yourself, before anyone else will love youâ€™, but loving yourself doesnâ€™t come naturally to everyone. Many people find it easier to show compassion and love to other people, but they find it hard to allow themselves to do the same. To find true happiness, it is just as important as to accept yourself for who you are, as it is to forgive other people for their flaws and their mistakes. So, be honest with yourself, be happy with who you are, and learn how to love that person that is inside you.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are ten tips on how you can do just that, and learn to love yourself more.</p><p><br></p><p>1. Forget your mistakes</p><p>You probably canâ€™t just wipe your mistakes from your memory, but, if you dwell on them, it will do you no good at all. We have all made mistakes in our lives and done things that we wish we hadnâ€™t, but stop beating yourself up about them, because you canâ€™t change the past. Learn how to forgive yourself, as easily as you forgive other people, and you will be one step closer to learning to love yourself.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>2. Stop trying to please everyone else</p><p>You donâ€™t need anyone elseâ€™s permission to be you and you donâ€™t need to win their approval. Sometimes you just have to do the things that will make you happy and, perhaps, even some things that other people will not like. Being a caring person is a noble trait, but you have to care for yourself too.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>3. Be grateful for who you are</p><p>Be grateful for who you are and what you have. Never lose sight of the fact that there will always be people in the world who do not have the things that you have, or that can do the things that you can do. This goes beyond being grateful for material possessions; it also includes the things that make you unique. Donâ€™t take your own talents and abilities for granted, remember that you can do things that other people can\'t.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>4. Make time for your passion</p><p>Most people have something that they are passionate about, so make time for your passion and follow your dreams. Whether itâ€™s a hobby, an ambition, or a favourite cause, one of the best ways that you can learn to love yourself more is to do the things that make you happy and give you a sense of achievement.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>5. Donâ€™t be afraid to sing your own praises</p><p>Be proud of yourself when you achieve something and donâ€™t be afraid to tell other people about it. There is nothing wrong in admitting that you did a good job and having some pride in what you do. It will help you to appreciate your own abilities. You should always celebrate your achievements, not hide them away.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>6. Believe in your own instincts</p><p>If you want to love someone, then you have to trust them, and that includes learning to trust yourself. Trust your instincts and follow up on the ideas that you have and you will be surprised at how many times you are right. Donâ€™t just assume that any ideas you have must be wrong, believe in yourself and, at least, give your ideas some thought, before you assign them to the garbage.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>7. Donâ€™t take life too seriously</p><p>If you take everything too seriously, you will never be able to make any decisions and you will never take any risks. Learn how to laugh things off, when they donâ€™t go to plan, and learn how to get up and give it another go. To be able to truly love yourself, you are going to need to be able laugh at yourself too.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>8. Enjoy everything as it happens</p><p>Loving you and loving life, go hand in hand, so live for the present and enjoy every moment as it comes along. Look up and see what is going on around you and be a part of what is happening today. Itâ€™s all too easy to look inward all the time and miss out on the really important things that are happing around you.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>9. Choose your friends wisely</p><p>Your friends should be the people who make you feel good about yourself, motivate you and inspire you, not the ones who bring you down. Unfortunately, there are people who just seem to have a knack of finding the negatives in anything, so avoid this type of person and spend your time with positive people instead.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>10. Never be ashamed of who and what you are</p><p>There are over 7 billion people in the world. Thatâ€™s billions of individuals, each one of whom is unique, with their own beliefs, their own abilities and their own flaws. Celebrate your own uniqueness each and every day and donâ€™t try and be someone else. You are who you are and you should be proud of that. You really should start to love that person too.</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.beautyandtips.com/motivation/10-tips-on-how-to-love-yourself-even-more/</p>', '3.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:51:54', 'Jun 30, 2021', '10-TIPS-ON-HOW-TO-LOVE-YOURSELF-EVEN-MORE', '', '2.jpg'),

Parenting a child or teen today requires an advanced degree in navigating, negotiating, and understanding media and technology. As much as they can be an invaluable resource for your child\'s growing mind, media and technology can also be debilitating forces. Obtaining that advanced degree involves surveying the options, identifying the pros and cons, and setting age-appropriate media and technology boundaries. Doing these things will help you \"discern what is the good\" (Romans 12:2).</p><p>Visual stimulants (TV, video games, movies, Internet, phones and other gadgets, and social networking sites), when used appropriately, have the power to provide early readiness for learning; educational enrichment; opportunities for relational connectedness; and broadened exposure to entertainment, the arts, and social issues. Media can also be a useful tool in teaching, training, and engaging your child.</p><p>The harmful effects of visual stimulants can range from poor school performance to violent and aggressive behavior, and diminished physical activity to distorted sexual and body image content. We\'ve long known that children\'s brains need to interact with their external environment in order to grow fully. It\'s possible that many of our children may be suffering attention and other learning difficulties because their brains aren\'t experiencing enough fine and gross motor development that comes from physical movement and engaging with the environment around them.</p><p>Studies have explored the relationship between visual media and a child or adolescent\'s sleep, learning, and memory. For example, there\'s clear evidence that prolonged video game playing disrupts sleep, which, in turn, affects memory and learning. Other studies have connected prolonged exposure to visual stimulants and deteriorated verbal and cognitive performance.</p><p>Early in life, visual stimulants compete for a child\'s developing mind. A media-savvy parent discovers how to use these to his or her advantage. In our family, I hold off allowing our kids to see movies if they haven\'t read the book. I remember racing to finish reading Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia (HarperCollins) with my daughter to make the May 2008 release of the film.</p><p>She disciplined herself to finish homework quickly so that we could squeeze in an extra half hour to finish another chapter or two at night. We devoured those pages and couldn\'t wait to compare and contrast the book with the film. The visual of the film helped reinforce the content and message of the story.</p><p>Occasionally, our family hosts Wii nights at our house and compete in anything from Olympic track-and-field events to baseball. It\'s become a way for us to engage with one another and be active. Although we use a video game as a means of staying connected, we experience joy spending time together.</p><p>Equally so, I use technology to our family\'s advantage when I travel. It\'s never been easier to stay connected to my kids when I\'m in another state. My daughter sends me email updates with photos of her weekend. My sons love to make and send videos to report on their basketball games. Furthermore, we video chat from state-to-state. When we can look at one another as opposed to just talking on the phone, we don\'t feel so distanced from one another.</p><p>Setting balanced media boundaries</p><p><br></p><p>1. Monitor time</p><p>Kids should never spend more time in the virtual world than in reality. Simply put, your children should never spend more time playing video or computer games than engaging in active play. They should spend more time having real conversations with their friends rather than through Facebook or texting.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Get online</p><p>Parents of preteens should have access to any social networking sites on which they choose to let their kids participate or explore. You should know their passwords at all times, and let them know that you can and will check them. Require that they \"friend\" you on Facebook, and let them know you check the Internet and device history on any computers or gadgets in your home.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Model limits</p><p>Pay attention to the amount of time you spend watching TV, checking email, surfing the Internet, or chatting on Facebook. You can talk all day about setting limits, but you need to be modeling them in your own life.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Bombard kids (with information)</p><p>Education and conversation are your best weapons against pornography and Internet dangers. Consider having your kids sign a media contract that outlines the terms of having technology in your home.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Avoid violence</p><p>Violent video games that reward antisocial aggression, such as \"Grand Theft Auto\" or \"Doom,\" shouldn\'t be permitted in your home. Playing violent first-person video games has a substantially more toxic effect than watching equally violent TV programs. Neither is healthy, but children are even more susceptible to behavioral influences when they\'re active participants.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Teach literacy</p><p>Just because preteens can use media and technology doesn\'t mean they\'re effective at critically analyzing and evaluating the messages they receive. This is called media literacy. A child\'s ability to distinguish between reality and fantasy can be developed through parental guidance.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Parent in community</p><p>Sit down with other parents you trust and talk openly about what ages you feel are appropriate to introduce different stimulants, such as a cellphone. At what age would you feel comfortable with your child watching a particular show? What are a reasonable number of texts to allow per month?</p><p>Parenting in community layers more support for those times when your son or daughter says things like, \"I\'m the only one,\" or \"No other parent.\" You can respond with, \"That\'s interesting, because I know that at the Johnsons\' house, the Allens\' house, and the Whitakers\' house, they\'ve decided to wait on that as well.\"</p><p>There\'s no doubt that media can be harmful just as there\'s no arguing that media can be useful. The key to navigating this complicated maze is for parents to stay educated, informed, engaged, and aware. If you\'re strategic, you can leverage these powerful forces as invaluable tools.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>David Thomas</p>', '9.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:53:06', 'Jun 30, 2021', '7-Ways-To-Set-Boundaries-for-Kids-in-a-Digital-Age', '', '2.jpg'),
(85, '1', '8 Stages of Puberty in Girls', '<p>While puberty brings a lot of changes to your life and your body, you should know youâ€™re not alone on this journey. All women â€” including your mom, female teachers and aunts â€” went through puberty. They can be a great resource for you as you have questions along the way.</p><p>As you prepare to grow into a beautiful, confident young lady it can be exciting, but also scary. But donâ€™t worry! Itâ€™s totally normal, and weâ€™ll be here for you. Read below to find out more about puberty in girls and the exciting changes that await you and other girls like you.</p><p><br></p><p>1. Body Growth</p><p>One major change you may notice is growing faster than you did during childhood. This is known as a growth spurt. First, you may notice your feet and hands getting bigger. Next, the arm and leg bones grow, making you taller. You may gain some weight to match the increase in your bone size. This may be an awkward time until the rest of the body catches up, but once it does, your body will be more proportional.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>2. bre*st Development</p><p>At first you may notice what feel like little buds, or swellings, under your nipples. After that, your breasts will gradually get bigger and fuller and may become a little sore. Wearing a bra will be important so you can have the proper support for your breasts. Check out the Bra Guide to find your size. Also, itâ€™s important to remember that every girl is different. How large or small your breasts become depends on the physical genetic traits in your family. Full bre*st development typically takes 2-3 years.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>3. Body Hair</p><p>Soon you will find new hair growing in new places. Curly hair will start growing in the pubic area (the area that extends from your lower stomach to between your legs). In some girls, pubic hair may appear before bre*st development. At first, this hair is soft, and there\'s not much of it. Later, the hair grows longer and becomes a little curly. Although it starts growing between the legs, it eventually covers the entire pubic area and may include the upper, inner thighs. This usually takes 2-3 years. A few months after pubic hair begins to grow, hair will also grow under your arms.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>4. Body Sweat</p><p><br></p><p>Your sweat glands will become larger and more active, causing you to sweat more. This may happen even before your breasts develop. Once this happens you will want to wear an antiperspirant/deodorant to help reduce sweating.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>5. Skin and Hair Changes</p><p>During puberty, the pores in your skin produce more oil, especially on your face. This can cause acne. You may have to wash your hair and face more often now that you\'re going through puberty. It would be a good idea to create a daily skin care routine to meet the needs of your changing skin.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>6. Genitals Develop</p><p>Your genitals, or private areas, also grow and change during puberty. Your outside parts (the vulva) are enclosed by two sets of \"lips.\" The larger lips have hair. The inner, smaller lips don\'t. These increase in size a little bit. Inside your body, the v*gina is getting longer and the uterus is getting bigger.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>7. Discharge Occurs</p><p>Discharge is a clear or cloudy fluid produced by your body to moisten and cleanse the vagina. Before you start your period, you\'ll probably notice yellow or white stains inside your underwear. This is natural moisture from the vagina. It\'s perfectly normal, and it\'s a sign that menstruation will likely start in six to 18 months. Sometimes, vaginal discharge can become white, clumpy, thick or milky. In this case, you might have a yeast infection. Talk to your parents or doctor if you have any questions.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>8. First Period Starts</p><p>All of these changes lead up to the start of your first period. You may not be sure whatâ€™s normal, but thereâ€™s no need to worry. When you first start menstruation, it can be unpredictable for the first two years. It typically takes 1-2 years for cycles to develop, so you may not be regular for a while.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Every girl develops differently and at her own pace, so donâ€™t be discouraged. These changes usually happen in the order listed above, but this may not be the order that they happen to you â€” and that is totally OK! No matter what order all these changes happen, just know youâ€™re on your way to becoming a woman â€” and that is an awesome thing!</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.familyparliament.com/2480/8-stages-of-puberty-in-girls-hair-and-other-signs</p>', '12.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 09:54:40', 'Jun 30, 2021', '8-Stages-of-Puberty-in-Girls', '', '2.jpg'),

(87, '1', ' 7 Things Your Teen Needs to Know About Purity', '<p>Don\'t have sex. It\'s a message teens have heard over and over again â€” especially teens who have grown up in church. And not without good reason. But teenagers need â€” and deserve â€” more than a command that can seem impossible to them. They need real, honest conversations with adults about purity in relationships.</p><p>&nbsp;Approximately one-half of all high school students have had sex, and 15 percent of high school students have had sex with four or more partners. However, of those teens who delay sex, the primary reason they give is religion or morals. So if you are teaching biblical principles in your home, you are on the right track. Sometimes, though, it can feel like an overwhelming topic to broach. Remembering the unique needs of teenagers in this area can help.</p><p><br></p><p>1. Teenagers need â€” and respect â€” honesty from adults about sex.</p><p>According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage Pregnancy, nine out of 10 teens say that they would be more likely to delay sex if their parents would talk to them about it. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also confirms that there is a relationship between parent/teen communication and decreased and delayed sexual activity. While it can certainly be awkward to talk about sex with your teen, they will get their information somehow â€” from their friends, or worse, the Internet. Push through the awkwardness and have those talks.</p><p>Use popular culture references such as viral videos or entertainment headlines (such as Miley Cyrus last fall at the VMA awards) as opportunities to discuss issues about sexuality, modesty, and body image.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Teenagers need to hear that sex is good.</p><p>Teens hear a lot about sex, but they don\'t often hear that it is holy and beautiful, and that God made us to desire and enjoy it. God has, out of His love for us, given us the command of reserving sex for marriage in order to protect us, not stifle us. Contrary to cultural belief, the purpose of sex is for the companionship, intimacy, and oneness that marriage provides. Guarding the sacredness of sex is for our highest good. Any sexual activity before marriage pales in comparison to the joy that comes from the unity of sex in marriage.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Teenagers need to understand what it means to live in obedience to God in their bodies.</p><p>What is sexual purity, exactly? Sexual purity is a collection of tiny decisions made every day, such as what to wear, what to read, how to love and respect our neighbor, that are born out of a daily walk with Christ. Purity goes right along with other spiritual disciplines, such as prayer and Bible study. These are practices that aren\'t always easy to implement, but result in profound peace and real growth in our faith.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Teenagers â€” especially girls â€” need to hear that their bodies are good and beautiful.</p><p>Teens are given two messages about their bodies: 1. They aren\'t \"enough\": pretty enough, skinny enough, muscular enough, or sexy enough; and 2. They need to avoid sex at all costs. This leaves many teens with a distorted view of their bodies as either inadequate or somehow dirty. Girls experimenting with beauty are enjoying their femininity, and guys who want to work out are pursuing a worthy goal. Teens shouldn\'t hate their bodies ... rather, they should seek to honor God with their bodies (1 Cor. 6:19-20).</p><p><br></p><p>5. Teenagers â€” both girls and boys â€” need parents to understand their world.</p><p>So you don\'t have a Tumblr account. That\'s OK, but do you know what it is and how it works? Your teen is an expert on what\'s out there online, so let her teach you. Do you know how your teen portrays herself on social media sites? Have you met her online friends in real life? With the heavy amounts of time teens spend online, whether by computer, tablet, or phone, being part of your teenager\'s world can help you know when to challenge her about her decisions, and guide her in a good direction.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Teenagers need to be involved in extracurricular activities.</p><p>One practical tool for encouraging your teen toward a life of sexual purity is simple: a full calendar. Team sports, arts involvement, and part-time jobs offer ways for teens to socialize, develop their gifts and talents, and use their youthful energy to benefit others.</p><p>Involvement in after-school activities means less time to hook up, and more time for positive social and emotional development. Not only are they practicing discipline, responsibility, and community service, but they are removing themselves from the troubles that too much isolation or exclusive dating can create.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Teenagers want to be guided, not controlled.</p><p>Despite popular belief, teenagers actually do want to hear what adults have to say. But they certainly don\'t like to be told what to do. Coming up with possible situations they may face ahead of time can help them make the right choice in the moment. For example, help your son list scenarios he might encounter while with his girlfriend that could lead to sexual temptation, such as spending too much time together alone, drinking alcohol, or being out too late at night. Ask what he thinks the consequences of his particular actions would be, or potential exit strategies. If he owns the decision and has planned it out ahead of time, he is more likely to do the right thing.</p><p>Of course parents can differ on the boundaries they set for their teens. Some ambiguity is inevitable: at what age is your teen ready to date? What is appropriate when it comes to spending time with someone of the opposite sex?</p><p>And the ubiquitous question, \"How far is too far?\" Rather than offering a quip answer to these questions, discuss them. Ask your teens what they think. Pray. Wrestle with these issues together. And remember that all the while the Holy Spirit is working in your teen\'s life to lead them to repentance, faith, and purity.

Stop expecting them to agree with you.</p><p>You deserve to be happy.&nbsp; You deserve to live a life you are excited about.&nbsp; Donâ€™t let the opinions of others make you forget that.&nbsp; You are not in this world to live up to the expectations of others, nor should you feel that others are here to live up to yours.&nbsp; In fact, the more you approve of your own decisions in life, the less approval you need from everyone else.</p><p>You have to dare to be yourself, and follow your own intuition, however frightening or strange that may feel or prove to be.&nbsp; Donâ€™t compare yourself to others.&nbsp; Donâ€™t get discouraged by their progress or success.&nbsp; Follow your own path and stay true to your own purpose.&nbsp; Success is ultimately about spending your life happily in your own way.</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to respect you more than you respect yourself.</p><p>True strength is in the soul and spirit, not in muscles.&nbsp; Itâ€™s about having faith and trust in who you are, and a willingness to act upon it.&nbsp; Decide this minute to never again beg anyone for the love, respect, and attention that you should be showing yourself.</p><p>Today, look at yourself in the mirror and say, â€œI love you, and from now on Iâ€™m going to act like it.â€&nbsp; Itâ€™s important to be nice to others, but itâ€™s even more important to be nice to yourself.&nbsp; When you practice self-love and self-respect, you give yourself the opportunity to be happy.&nbsp; When you are happy, you become a better friend, a better family member, and a better YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp; Stop expecting (and needing) them to like you.</p><p>You might feel unwanted and unworthy to one person, but you are priceless to another.&nbsp; Donâ€™t ever forget your worth.&nbsp; Spend time with those who value you.&nbsp; No matter how good you are to people, there will always be one negative person who criticizes you.&nbsp; Smile, ignore them, and carry on.</p><p>In this crazy world thatâ€™s trying to make you like everyone else, the toughest battle youâ€™ll ever have to fight is the battle to be yourself.&nbsp; And as youâ€™re fighting back, not everyone will like you.&nbsp; Sometimes people will call you names because youâ€™re â€œdifferent.â€&nbsp; But thatâ€™s perfectly OK.&nbsp; The things that make you different are the things that make YOU, and the right people will love you for it.</p><p><br></p><p>4.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to fit your idea of who they are.</p><p>Loving and respecting others means allowing them to be themselves.&nbsp; When you stop expecting people to be a certain way, you can begin to appreciate THEM.</p><p>Pay close attention, and respect people for who they are and not for who you want them to be.&nbsp; We donâ€™t know most people half as well as we believe we do; and truly knowing someone is a big part of what makes them wonderful.&nbsp; Every human being is remarkable and beautiful; it just takes a patient set of eyes to see it.&nbsp; The more you get to know someone, the more you will be able to look beyond their appearance and see the beauty of who they truly are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to know what youâ€™re thinking.</p><p>People canâ€™t read minds.&nbsp; They will never know how you feel unless you tell them.&nbsp; Your boss?&nbsp; Yeah, he doesnâ€™t know youâ€™re hoping for a promotion because you havenâ€™t told him yet.&nbsp; That cute guy you havenâ€™t talked to because youâ€™re too shy?&nbsp; Yeah, you guessed it, he hasnâ€™t given you the time of day simply because you havenâ€™t given him the time of day either.</p><p>In life, you have to communicate with others regularly and effectively.&nbsp; And often, you have to open your vocal cords and speak the first words.&nbsp; You have to tell people what youâ€™re thinking.&nbsp; Itâ€™s as simple as that.</p><p><br></p><p>6.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to suddenly change.</p><p>If thereâ€™s a specific behavior someone you care about has that youâ€™re hoping disappears over time, it probably wonâ€™t.&nbsp; If you really need them to change something, be honest and put all the cards on the table so this person knows how you feel and what you need them to do.</p><p>For the most part though, you canâ€™t change people and you shouldnâ€™t try.&nbsp; Either you accept who they are or you choose to live without them.&nbsp; It might sound harsh, but itâ€™s not.&nbsp; When you try to change people, they often remain the same, but when you donâ€™t try to change them â€“ when you support them and allow them the freedom to be as they are â€“ they gradually change in the most beautiful way.&nbsp; Because what really changes is the way you see them.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>7.&nbsp; Stop expecting them to be â€œOK.â€</p><p>Be kinder than necessary, for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle, just like you.&nbsp; Every smile or sign of strength hides an inner struggle every bit as complex and extraordinary as your own.</p><p>Remember that embracing your light doesnâ€™t mean ignoring your dark.&nbsp; We are measured by our ability to overcome adversities and insecurities, not avoid them.&nbsp; Supporting, sharing and making contributions to other people is one of lifeâ€™s greatest rewards.&nbsp; This happens naturally if we allow it, because we all share very similar dreams, needs and struggles.&nbsp; Once we accept this, the world then is a place where we can look someone else in the eye and say, â€œIâ€™m lost and struggling at the moment,â€ and they can nod and say, â€œMe too,â€ and thatâ€™s OK.&nbsp; Because not being â€œOKâ€ all the time, is perfectly OK.</p><p><br></p><p>Afterthoughts</p><p>People rarely behave exactly the way you want them to.&nbsp; Hope for the best, but expect less.&nbsp; And remember, the magnitude of your happiness will be directly proportional to your thoughts and how you choose to think about things.&nbsp; Even if a situation or relationship doesnâ€™t work out at all, itâ€™s still worth it if it made you feel something new, and if it taught you something new.</p><p><br></p><p>Your turnâ€¦</p><p>What would you add to this post?&nbsp;

(90, '1', '6 Practical Tips for Guiding Your Stressed-Out Teen', '<p><br></p><p>Do-or-die tests, overwhelming homework, impossible schedules, complicated relationships and looming decisions. When should you step in?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Does your teen have too much stress?</p><p>If he or she is anything like the typical teenager, the answer is a resounding yes.</p><p>Earlier this year, an American Psychological Association survey reported that teens across the U.S. have stress levels high enough to affect almost every part of their lives, with more than 27 percent saying they experience extreme stress during the school year.</p><p>A variety of physical and emotional dangersâ€”including shorter life spans than their parentsâ€”could be on the horizon if teens don\'t \"reverse their current trajectory\" of chronic illness and poor health, the report warns. But you don\'t need a survey to tell you that. If you\'re the parent of a teenager, you see first-hand the strain your teen is under.</p><p><br></p><p>Common Stressors</p><p>Sometimes stress is caused by a big event, but it may also come in small everyday stressors: homework, tests, decisions about the future, teacher problems, and relationship issues, family problems, home responsibilities, the pressure to look a certain way, being bullied, schedule overload, or the pressure to experiment with drugs, alcohol, or sex.</p><p><br></p><p>Just to name a few.</p><p>The sources of stress may vary by your teen\'s age. Early teens face rapid change as they go through puberty and navigate changing relationships with friends and the opposite sex.</p><p>They also must adjust to increased school demands. In the middle of the teen years, they may become anxious about entering high school, making top grades and getting their first jobs. Once in their older teen years they face the same stressors with the added strain of making decisions about college and a career. They may feel the pressure to succeed as adults or make adult-like decisions even though they don\'t have the life experience to do so.</p><p>Not sure if your teen is under too much stress? The best way to know is by staying involved in his or her life and watching for signs that may signal stress-things like anxiety, irritable behavior, moodiness, stomach problems or headaches, sleep issues, sadness, anger or even depression.</p><p>How can you help your teen if he or she is feeling stressed? Or better yet, how can you help prevent that stress from happening? Thankfully, there are a few things you can do.</p><p><br></p><p>1. Set a limit on your teen\'s activities.</p><p>Too many activities-even good activities-is one of the main causes of stress. Schedule overload happens when teens try to do it all: school, part-time jobs, sports teams, church activities, clubs, band, fundraisers, and dance classes. All of these activities might be good ones, but your teen most likely can\'t (and shouldn\'t have to) keep up with all of them at once.</p><p>Sit down together and have your teen write down his or her daily activities. Make up a daily schedule and see how much free time is left. Decide together what changes need to be made.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Help your teen be realistic.</p><p>If your teen is taking classes beyond his ability, the pressure will build. Or if he\'s demanding more of himself than what is healthy or possible, he\'s setting himself up for stress.</p><p>Is he working on projects beyond his ability? Trying to take part in activities that just aren\'t right for him? Taking AP classes when he\'s not ready? Help your teen develop realistic expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Work with your teen on basic problem-solving skills.</p><p>Sometimes stress is caused by many small problems left unsolved. Instead of avoiding a problem, your teen can learn to take steps to solve problems as they occur. Look at each problem, and determine what the real issue is. Then look for possible solutions. Share with your teen some problems you\'ve had and how you solved them.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Help your teen take time for fun and relaxation.</p><p>Exercise is a great stress reliever, so encourage your teen to turn off electronics and head outdoors. Plan family activities that encourage both togetherness and fitness.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Monitor your teen\'s sleep habits.</p><p>When a teen has a too-full schedule, sleep is often neglected. Because your teen is growing so quickly, she needs plenty of sleep. Find consistency in when she goes to bed and gets up each day.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Model Philippians 4:6-7.</p><p>\"Don\'t worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

This leads the body to low body temperature and produces less sweat. Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water daily to reduce sweating.</p><p>Eat fruits and vegetable: Fresh fruits such as cherries, watermelons, apples, oranges etc vegetables such as tofu, beans, salad and even red meat, egg, fish gives the body required amount of nutrient when consumed with low fat oil and reduces sweating.</p><p>Cold shower: Cold water works wonder, use antibacterial soap to ensure the body is clean and odour free.</p><p>Natural supplements: Take natural supplements that contains vitamin B complex, vitamin C and E, zinc, essential fatty acids, lecithin capsule etc. They are natural supplements and remedies that can be use to treat excessive sweating.</p><p>Sugary and spicy foods: Stay away from sugary and spicy foods because they cause the body to sweat more frequently.</p><p>Tomato juice: Drink tomato juice.

Listen to music</p><p>Though it\'s probably best to avoid the really mopey Radiohead tracks, the cheering effects of music don\'t really depend on genre.

Connect with friends or family</p><p>Studies have shown that holding a spouse\'s hand reduces stress, while hearing your mom\'s voice releases similar feel-good hormones to a hug. So reach out; whether it\'s scheduling a coffee break with your S.O. or ducking into the hall to call family, do it. Connecting with loved ones can make you feel better on a chemical level, and (perhaps more importantly), remind you that you have support outside of work.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Take a coffee break</p><p>Getting away from your desk is a great way to perk up anyway, but the caffeine from a trip to the coffee shop can be instantly uplifting as well.

(94, '1', '10 Things Every Teenage Girl Needs to Know', '<p>I remember walking down those huge halls, surrounded by the buzz of morning chatter and the gossip of the weekend. I can almost still hear the sound of the slamming lockers, and smell the faint odor of cafeteria food looming in the air.</p><p>Walking down those halls was never an easy task. I always felt like I was on displayâ€¦like there some sort of a spotlight shining on me, everyâ€¦whereâ€¦Iâ€¦went. It was like constantly being under a magnifying glass- with every flaw being projected to the world in HD.</p><p>If Iâ€™m honest, I struggled a lot with my self-esteem as a teenager, and succumbed to the pressure of my peers probably one too many times.</p><p>Letâ€™s not beat around the bushâ€“ the teenage years are straight up difficult. Itâ€™s hard to navigate the right and wrongs, to think ahead, and to know whatâ€™s good for you. Itâ€™s hard to feel beautiful, valuable, and strong when youâ€™re constantly comparing yourself to the world around you.</p><p>There are so many things I know now, that I wish I could have known then. Here are 10 things I wish every teenage girl could hear:</p><p>1. You are valuable standing alone! I wasted so much time during my teen years focusing on guys! I felt insignificant and alone without their attention. I wish I would have known that my value is something that I choose to believe inâ€“ not something someone gives me. Girls, you are amazing, beautiful, and special right here, right now, just as you are. Donâ€™t ever give in to the pressure to use your body, your words, or your actions in a compromising way just to get his attention. You are enough. Learn to believe that now, because that truth will change your entire life!</p><p>2. How you dress will attract a certain kind of guy. I know you get it girls- we all want to catch their eye donâ€™t we? But what we donâ€™t always realize is that when you catch a guy with your body, youâ€™ll have to keep him with your body. There is so much more about who you are than the size of your boobs or the size of your waist. Learn to respect yourself, and accentuate the beauty of your heart, your mind, and your spirit. Because those are exactly the kind of things that will snag a really good man.</p><p>3. Your parents might not always get it, but they usually know whatâ€™s good for you. I know itâ€™s hard to believe now, because it seems like they are so far removed from what youâ€™re going through, but one thing I wish I would have done during my teen years is actually pay more attention to what my parents were saying. They knew me and loved me better than I even knew and loved myself, and the limits they set were almost always for my good. Now that I have children, I see that more than I ever could have imagined. I wish I would have trusted them more.</p><p>4. Hang in there; no matter how bad it feels right now, it will pass. If you thought the last lesson was hard to believe, this oneâ€™s even harder. I get it â€“that breakup, those betraying friends, the gossip thatâ€™s going around about youâ€“ can feel like the most devastating things in the moment. But as hard as they are, and as bad as you may feel, believe me: IT WILL PASS. Donâ€™t be afraid to cry out for help, to talk to someone you love, and to reach out. But always remember that you are strong, you are capable, and you will get through this. Donâ€™t give it the power to ruin your life.</p><p>5. You teach people how they are allowed to treat you. I have to admit, Iâ€™m still learning this one at times. But the truth is, you have more control than you could even imagine. You are allowed to walk away, to distance yourself, and to put a stop to those people who are treating you poorly. Teach people how they can treat you, by setting your standards high. You owe it to yourself.</p><p>6. Donâ€™t care so much about what people think. Itâ€™s easy to place our value in what people think of us, but weâ€™ll find ourselves on a never-ending emotional roller coaster when we realize we will never, ever make everyone happy. Love life, make good choices, do the right thing, and always live for an audience of One.</p><p>7. The road less traveled is usually the right one. I remember saying NO to so many things that everyone else seemed to be saying YES to. I canâ€™t even tell you how hard that was at times, and how much I wanted to give in to that pressure. But now that Iâ€™m here, I look back and I canâ€™t even thank God enough for helping me choose the road less traveled, and making good choices even when it was hard. Just because everyoneâ€™s doing it, doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s good. Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t have to learn that the hard way.</p><p>8. Your body doesnâ€™t define youâ€“you define yourself. Teen or not, this is something we wrestle with as girls on and off throughout our lives. But the truth is, we canâ€™t let our bodies define us, because we have the power to define ourselves. Take the time to love yourself, to focus on your strengths, and to be grateful for the body God has given you. And then remember: You are the daughter of A King â€“ live like it!</p><p>9. Be yourself, because everyone else is already taken. I remember trying so hard to fit in to places and people that I was never meant to fit. It took a while to find myself after losing myself in the crowd of everyone I was trying to be. But I finally learned to embrace myself, love my personality, and appreciate my quirks. God made you special just the way you are- so be yourself.</p><p>10. God has an amazing plan for your life, but itâ€™s up to you to choose it. I think itâ€™s easy to forget that good things can really happen. Itâ€™s easy to be filled with fears and worries in the moment, and doubt Godâ€™s great plans and purpose for our life. Sometimes we settle for an okay life, because we donâ€™t believe thereâ€™s something better. But beautiful girls, you are destined for great things! Believe it, and then live it.</p><p>Sometimes I sit and think how these lessons would have saved me so much heartache and pain, because as Maya Angelou says, when you know better, you do better.</p><p>My prayer for every precious girl reading this is that you would know and believe that you are loved, that you are prayed for, and that you deserve great things. Know better, but more importantlyâ€“ go out there and do better.</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.crosswalk.com/family/parenting/10-things-every-teenage-girl-needs-to-know.html</p>', '29.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 10:03:34', 'Jun 30, 2021', '10-Things-Every-Teenage-Girl-Needs-to-Know', '', '2.jpg'),
(96, '1', '5 Ways to Open Lines of Communication with Your Teen ', '<p>One of the biggest complaints from parents and teenagers alike is that there is often little or no communication between the two groups. Perhaps youâ€™re like one discouraged mom who said to me, â€œIâ€™ve tried to talk with my daughter but she just shuts me down. Iâ€™ve tried everything to let her know I care but she just wonâ€™t let me in any more.â€ Or maybe youâ€™re like the frustrated dad who told me the only thing his son would ever say to him was â€œyou just donâ€™t understand.â€&nbsp;</p><p>In such cases teens and parents alike are hurting. Parents would love to know how to talk to their kids and most teens would love for that to happen; they simply think their parents are out of touch. The good news is there is something that can be done to keep the lines of communication open between you and your teenager.</p><p><br></p><p>First, show genuine interest in your teenâ€™s life.&nbsp;</p><p>Often a teenager will perceive his parent to be too busy to really talk. The times that conversations do occur, your son or daughter might think youâ€™re preoccupied even though you think youâ€™re talking. Your one word responses or grunts say to your teen that you do indeed have other things on your mind. Make sure youâ€™re actually listening and engaging. Speak with understanding. Ask questions. Be interested in what your daughter is even if you have no interest in it at all. Make every effort to ask heart-felt questions and get wrapped-up in what your child is wrapped-up in at a given moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, be truly empathetic with your teen.&nbsp;</p><p>Your daughter may be trying to open up or tell you something really important in her life. If you respond with opinions that donâ€™t seem connected to her world, if you spit out platitudes or orders without seeming to empathize, if you donâ€™t seem to take into account every factor weighing on your childâ€™s heart, or if you tend to give advice on the go, your child will get the impression that you want her to do certain things but youâ€™re not really interested in what sheâ€™s going through. When she feels that, sheâ€™ll begin to shut down more and more. You have to identify with what sheâ€™s feeling even if you donâ€™t completely understand why she would feel the way she does.</p><p><br></p><p>Third, donâ€™t give your teen the third degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when your son has done something wrong you still want to communicate and not do anything to shut him down. Sometimes we can approach our kids like prosecutors cross-examining a hostile witness; and they feel that way too. Rather than pelting your son with questions like â€œwhat did you do; who was with you; donâ€™t you know better; havenâ€™t we taught you better; what were you thinking; how could you do such a thing; have you lost your mind; can I get some answers; and the like, try a more biblical approach. Gently ask your teen what happened and give him time to explain in his own words. Let him know you love him no matter what, that youâ€™ve been through similar struggles, and that you really want to help. Help him to clarify what his motives were and talk about how to think biblically about them. Help him to understand all the reasons not to do what heâ€™s done. Your teen needs to see you as a parent but he also needs to know that you are there to help by pointing him to Christ and not simply trying to come down on him.</p><p><br></p><p>Fourth, hear your teenâ€™s heart.&nbsp;</p><p>Understand what your teen is trying to say to you. Part of that is making sure you and she mean the same things with the words you are using. Ask clarifying questions. Say things like, â€œdo you mean . . . ?â€ Not only will she appreciate it but you wonâ€™t be talking past each other. You have to hear your teenâ€™s heart. She canâ€™t always say it like you would say it or even the way you would like her to say it. But she is saying something and you can work to get it. Realize the dynamic works in both directions as well. In other words, you might say, â€œI never thought you could be capable of doing such a thing. I might have thought it about your brother, but not you.â€ If you say that more than once, particularly if some time has gone by, she might interpret that to mean you donâ€™t love her or that you donâ€™t forgive her. Translation is just as important as what you say.</p><p><br></p><p>Fifth, be ready to talk when your teenager is.&nbsp;</p><p>Hectic schedules keep teens and parents separated. Your son may be ready to talk just when you were ready to read the paper or even go to bed. You might prefer to wait but the schedule may not allow it, your son may misinterpret your putting him off, he may seek an answer elsewhere, or he may not be in the mood to talk later and your opportunity will be gone forever. Rest in Godâ€™s providence and count those late night conversations as blessings, not inconveniences.</p><p>These are just a few tips. But, putting these into practice will help you and your teen to stay connected and maintain a relationship that can actually get better over time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>http://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/dr-paul-j-dean/top-five-ways-to-keep-communicating-with-your-teenager.html</p>', '13.jpg', '', 'Anonymous', 'anonymous@teensyouths.com.ng', 0, 0, '2021-06-22 10:05:41', 'Jun 30, 2021', '5-Ways-to-Open-Lines-of-Communication-with-Your-Teen-', '', '2.jpg'),
